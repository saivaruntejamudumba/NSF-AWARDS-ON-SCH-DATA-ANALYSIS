This project aims to develop intelligent clinical decision support techniques for recommending optimal action plans - including both diagnostic tests and medical interventions - for treating chronic disease, performing multi-step and adaptive treatments, and modifying long-term health habits. In an effort to integrate evidence-driven decision-making with established clinical practices, the research will develop disease-agnostic artificial intelligence techniques that combine data from large electronic health records (EHRs) with recommendations from human experts. A prototype decision support system will be tested on three clinical settings - cardiology, clinical depression, and emergency room readmission - using existing EHR datasets and consultation with domain experts from clinical partners. Outcomes-driven and cost-driven optimized decisions will be compared to current clinical practice. This exploratory research will provide the groundwork for follow-up projects in decision support information presentation, integration with clinical workflow and IT systems, and making the transition from retrospective studies to clinical trials.  Other broader impacts include workshops for healthcare applications of AI, and women and minority students will be recruited and mentored in graduate and undergraduate computer science research.<br/><br/>The technical approach of this research builds on state-of-the-art machine learning and artificial intelligence methods to automatically learn, simulate, and reason about patient-specific treatment plans.  Such methods must be simultaneously probabilistic and temporal.  Probabilistic techniques are needed to handle significant uncertainties in clinical diagnoses and outcomes, much like a human clinician would.  Temporal techniques are needed to consider sequences of future decisions over the course of treatment, rather than decisions at single time points.  More specifically, this project will consider the use of statistical relational learning (SRL) techniques to mine for probabilistic, temporal patterns in large electronic health records, and these patterns will be used in partially-observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) that exhaustively search for optimal treatment sequences. Recent results indicate that SRL achieves superior performance to other machine learning methods in predicting cardiac arrest from demographic and lifestyle observations, and POMDP treatment plans outperform existing fee-for-service practices by reducing costs by 50% and improving outcomes by 40% on a clinical depression dataset.  By combining SRL and POMDPs, specifically, using SRL to learn a disease progression model used by the POMDP, this project aims to achieve further improvements in recommendation quality and computational scalability for complex treatments.  Furthermore, because EHRs may suffer from limited or missing data, clinical decision support tools should follow established practices and expert knowledge when necessary.  To do so, new workflows for integrating expert knowledge into SRL and POMDPs will be explored.  Evaluation will be performed on a variety of disease scenarios in conjunction with clinical partners at Marshfield Clinic, Centerstone, Wake Forest School of Medicine, and South Bend Memorial Hospital.",University of California-San Diego,,,12/2/2496,"$5,174,242.00 "

Air pollutant concentrations near roadways may be up to orders of magnitude higher than average air pollutant levels in urban areas. Further, according to the EPA, transportation accounts for 26% of greenhouse gasses in the United States. Recent research at Portland State University, in collaboration with the City of Portland, Oregon, indicates that a relatively simple technique - modifying the timings of traffic signals - has the potential to reduce vehicle emissions in cities. However, this preliminary research needs to be explored more fully to evaluate its potential. This project would scale the work from a single location to a full transportation corridor, namely the Powell-Division Corridor. In addition, this project will investigate how data management technology can be applied to scale the air quality analysis. The techniques resulting from our exploratory research are expected to inform efforts to advance 'Smart City' approaches in multiple domains.  The proposed project capitalizes on unique and time-sensitive resources and opportunities to design an innovative and potentially transformative approach to address a globally relevant problem - reducing traffic-related air emissions. The proposed work has the potential to affect the lives of urban citizens by identifying a relatively easy to implement method for reducing vehicle emissions and thereby reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving air quality and reducing pedestrian exposure to air pollutants. This project directly contributes to the Portland (Oregon) Global Cities  Challenge (GCTC) Action Cluster, recently awarded the $20,000 leadership award at the GCTC 2016 Exposition. The project also aligns with the City of Portland's Ubiquitous Mobility for Portland (UB Mobile PDX) initiative, one of seven finalists in the U.S. Department of Transportation Smart Cities Challenge.<br/><br/><br/>This project will investigate and develop Cyber Physical Systems technology, particularly data management technology, to address systematic issues observed in data cleaning and data integration of air quality and transportation data. In practice, data integration and cleaning are still typically automated in an ad-hoc fashion; existing systematic data integration and cleaning technologies do not effectively support scaling of these processes. This project proposes to develop a concept we call Agile Integration, which is designed to address the complex dynamics associated with rapid increases in environmental sensing data, the accelerating pace of change in cities, and mounting pressures on data-intensive decision making. Techniques for semi-automated data cleaning and processing will also be developed to better capture human decisions and judgments that go into data integration. The results will be implemented in a prototype Cyber-Physical System for Data Integration for dense sensor networks. In the long term, the proposed work has the potential to impact the lives of everyday citizens by validating a potential method for reducing vehicle emissions through signal timing changes. Vehicle emissions in urban areas impact greenhouse gas emissions and urban air quality. Since minority and low-socioeconomic status populations disproportionately reside in close proximity to major roadways, the potential impacts of this project directly affect those often underserved populations. Further, the scalability problems described above, while exemplified by the air quality research for this proposal, also appear in the transportation domain and in others such as healthcare, education and environmental sensing. Thus the techniques developed through this project are expected to be extensible to those domains. The work will produce an improved understanding of lower-cost air quality sensors. In terms of educational goals, this project will engage students from PSU?s atmospheric science REU that specifically recruits Native American and rural Oregonians. Results will be disseminated to the computer science, transportation, and air quality professional communities, thus impacting at least three research domains.",Indiana University,,,4/6/3080,"$4,877,286.00 "

As a result, there is a lack of real-time monitoring data, such as symptom reports from high-risk groups and severe environmental pollution, causing notoriously long latency for effective prevention of the spread of epidemic diseases. This project is to address the fundamental challenges on collecting and analyzing multi-scale data from multi-sources for environmental public health in a privacy-preserving manner. The developed technologies empower each individual in a community to proactively contribute real-time data of themselves and surroundings for the betterment of public health without compromising his/her privacy.

By considering the high sensitivity and distributed manner of the data from patients and users, this project addresses the privacy preservation in two-fold: 1) completely redesign efficient collaborative classification schemes by applying novel metrics without leaking individual's privacy; and 2) introduce new architectures to perform crowdsourcing data analysis by using light-weighted and verifiable encryption schemes. This project also grounds the theoretical outcomes to actual crowdsensing systems and social networks for validation.

The obesity epidemic is the primary cause of recent increases in heart disease, diabetes, cancer, and other diseases that place an untenable strain on healthcare and public health. One of the primary behavioral causes, i.e. dietary intake, is a behavior that science has had little success in understanding, much less affecting. Recent advances in remote sensing have provided a new paradigm for tracking human behavior, but obesity-related efforts focused directly on diet and activity have been hampered by not only the accuracy of behavior tracking (especially dietary intake) but also the lack of behavioral theories and dynamic models for personalized just-in-time, adaptive interventions (JITAIs). Current behavioral science suggests that family eating dynamics (FED) have high potential to impact child and parent dietary intake and obesity rates. The confluence of technology research and behavioral science research creates the opportunity to change the focus of in situ obesity research and intervention from behaviors that have proven difficult to monitor, model, and modify (e.g., what and how much is being eaten) to the family mealtime and home food environment (e.g., who is eating, when, where, with whom, interpersonal stress), providing opportunities for monitoring and modeling (M2) behavior via remote sensing, and the potential for successful behavior modification via personalized, adaptable, real-time feedback.<br/><br/>This project proposes M2FED, an integrated system of in-home beacons, wireless and wearable sensors, and smartphones that collects synchronized real-time FED data that will be used to iteratively develop dynamic, contextualized FED systems models based on that data. The technology, ideographic models, and techniques to iteratively develop those models can guide future JITAIs and thus have a downstream positive impact on diet and ultimately obesity. The project brings together behavioral scientists, system scientists, obesity experts, computer scientists, and electrical engineers to address fundamental challenges of remote, continuous data capture for real-time behavior modeling for obesity prevention and treatment. Behavioral scientists traditionally have not had access to real-time data and dynamic models, while engineers have not had the expertise to identify what to monitor and model or what feedback to provide. This project connects complimentary expertise to develop a dramatically different approach to childhood obesity, focusing on behaviors, i.e. FED rather than diet, that can be more accurately monitored and modeled and have greater potential for positive and long-term modification. Fundamental technology research challenges in realizing the M2FED system include unique individual in-home localization, eating detection, conversation stress and mood assessment in reverberant environments, and a system-of-systems framework that includes heterogeneous sensing and communication systems across the family system itself. Fundamental behavioral research challenges include real-time modeling of FED based on past and ongoing observations of FED states and intra- and interpersonal states and events that create temporal and causal impact on FED. While this project is performed within the context of the obesity/FED relationship (which itself has the potential for sweeping impacts on human health and healthcare costs), the project also generalizes a framework, including both an evidence-based system and an experimental platform that extends to systems and applications beyond childhood obesity and behavior modification. The multidisciplinary nature of this work also provides new outreach and educational opportunities, informing (and being informed by) the public and preparing a workforce that is better equipped to address the fundamental human-behavior-centric challenges of health management and wellness preservation.",Carnegie-Mellon University,,,10/3/2612,"$4,050,717.00 "

Second, it may provide more information for  researchers seeking new scientific approaches for early treatment and intervention.

It will also include participation of groups underrepresented in STEM through recruiting new students, integrating the research training in a highly diverse laboratory, and exploring multidisciplinary, research applied to real-world problems in biomedical science and engineering.<br/><br/>This project proposes to extend machine learning techniques to a) incorporate privileged information in algorithm training (data routinely available in retrospective databases but not live clinical environments) and b) to account of uncertainty in training labels (because even medical experts have uncertainty in medical diagnosis). These approaches will lead to more accurate and efficient algorithms for the detection of medical conditions where diagnostic uncertainty is common. The project will develop effective signal processing techniques to identify perturbations associated with respiratory insufficiency and ARDS development in time series data. The project will also develop image processing techniques that extract clinically relevant features from digital chest radiographs of the lungs that could improve the accuracy of real-time clinical diagnosis in many respiratory that are frequently difficulty to distinguish among.

The proposed techniques eliminate the violation of privacy through re-identification, and facilitate the secondary usage, sharing, publishing and exchange of healthcare data without the risk of breaching protected health information (PHI). This new privacy-preserving framework injects the ICD-9-CM-aware constraint-based privacy-preserving techniques into EHRs to eliminate the threat of identifying an individual in the secondary use of research data. The proposed technique and development can be readily adapted to other types of healthcare databases in order to ensure privacy and prevent re-identification of published data. The project produces groundbreaking algorithms and tools for identifying privacy leakages and protecting personal privacy information in EHRs to improve healthcare data publishing. New privacy-preserving techniques developed in this project lead towards a new type of healthcare science for EHRs. The project also delivers fundamental advancements to engineering by showing how to integrate biomedical domain knowledge with a computationally advanced quantitative framework for preserving the privacy of published EHRs. HIPAA has established protocols and industry standards to protect the confidentiality of PHI. However, our results demonstrate that, even with regard to health data that meets HIPAA requirements, the risk of re-identification is not completely eliminated. By identifying the security vulnerabilities inherent in the HIPAA standards, our research develops a more rigorous security standard that greatly improves privacy protections by applying state-of-the-art algorithms.<br/> <br/>The developed data privacy-preserving framework has significant implications for the future of US healthcare data publishing and related applications. Specifically, the transition from paper records to EHRs has accelerated significantly since the passage of the HITECH Act of 2009. The Act provides monetary incentives for the ""meaningful use"" of EHRs. As a result, the quality and quantity of healthcare databases has risen sharply, which has renewed the public's fear of a breach of privacy of their medical information. This research work is innovative and crucial not only for facilitating EHR data publishing, but also for enhancing the development and promotion of EHRs. At the educational front, this project facilitates the development of novel educational tools to construct entirely new courses and laboratory classes for healthcare, data privacy, data mining, and a wide range of applications. As a result, it enhances the current instructional methods for teaching data privacy and data mining, and has compelling biomedical and healthcare applications that can facilitate learning of computational algorithms.

One limitation to effective disaster response is easy and rapid access to diverse information about available resources, community resource needs, baseline and current environmental conditions. This project aims to expand access to environmental and drinking water quality disaster response and recovery data in a publicly available format using a widely used collaborative online sharing platform named HydroShare.   Curating a central repository of assembled data has the potential to greatly facilitate coordinated disaster responses of all types, and improve the monitoring of the recovery process. The project team will prototype this system with an assessment of drinking water, environment, and public health concerns unique to Puerto Rico in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria. By working directly with public water utilities, the project team intends to characterize and map the severity of impaired water resources and distribution systems in Puerto Rico, inform communities about how to protect themselves against hazards specific to their water, and to contribute to rebuilding so the nation is better prepared for future hurricanes. Developing cyber and social infrastructure to understand the dynamics of drinking water contamination after natural disasters will improve disaster preparedness and response, and contribute to efforts across the nation and the world to build for a resilient future.<br/><br/>Recovery efforts from natural disasters can be more efficient with data-driven information on current needs and future risks. This project aims to advance open-source software infrastructure to support scientific investigation and data-driven decision making with a prototype system using a water quality assessment developed to investigate post-Hurricane Maria drinking water contamination in Puerto Rico. The widespread disruption of water treatment processes and uncertain drinking water quality within distribution systems in Puerto Rico poses risk to human health. However, there is no existing digital infrastructure to scientifically determine the impacts of the hurricane to inform a response to the crisis. After every natural disaster, including hurricane Maria, elementary questions on how to provide high quality water supplies and support basic human health are difficult to answer.  This project will archive and make accessible data on environmental variables unique to Puerto Rico and Hurricane Maria, damage caused by the storm, and will begin to address time sensitive needs of citizens. By working directly with drinking water utilities to collect samples of biological and inorganic drinking water quality, this project aims to generate understanding and awareness of the degree to which drinking water systems were impacted by Hurricane Maria and the status of drinking water infrastructure and emergency recovery in Puerto Rico after the storm. The goal of this project is to advance understanding of how the severity of a hazard to human health (e.g., no access to safe culinary water) is related to the sophistication, connectivity, and operations of the physical and related digital infrastructure systems. By rapidly collecting data in the early stages of recovery, the team plans to test the design of an integrated cyberinfrastructure system to increase the accessibility of environmental and health data for understanding the impacts from hurricane-related natural disasters. The team will test and stress the CUAHSI HydroShare data publication mechanisms and capabilities to (1) assess the spatial and temporal presence of waterborne pathogens in public water systems impacted by a natural disaster, (2) demonstrate usability of HydroShare as a clearinghouse to centralize selected datasets related to Hurricane Maria, and (3) develop a prototype cyberinfrastructure to assess environmental conditions and public health impacted by natural disasters.

About 700,000 people die annually in US hospitals and 16% of them were diagnosed with sepsis (including a high prevalence of severe sepsis with major  complication). In addition to being deadly, sepsis is the most expensive condition associated with in-hospital stay, resulting in a 75% longer stay than any other condition.  The total burden of sepsis to the US healthcare system is estimated to be $20.3 billion, most of which is paid by Medicare and Medicaid. In fact, in June 2015 the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) reported that sepsis accounted for over $7 billion in Medicare payments (second only to major joint replacement), a close to 10% increase from the previous year.  This pervasive drain on health care resources is due, in part, to difficulties in diagnosis and delayed treatment. For example, every one hour delay in treatment of severe sepsis/shock with antibiotics decreases a patient's survival probability by 10%. Many of these deaths could have been averted or postponed if a better system of care was in place.

For one, most Americans engage in daily driving, and patient's time spent in vehicles is a missed opportunity to monitor their condition and general wellbeing. The goal of this project is to develop and evaluate technology for automatic in-vehicle monitoring of early symptoms of medical conditions and disrupted medications of patients, and to provide preventive care. Specifically, in this project we will focus on Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in teenagers and young adults, a prevalent chronic medical condition which when uncontrolled has the potential for known negative health and quality of life consequences. The approach of using driving behavior to monitor ADHD symptoms could be applied to many other medical conditions (such as diabetes, failing eyesight, intoxication, fatigue or heart attacks) thereby transforming medical management into real-time sensing and management. Identification of all these conditions from driving behavior and alerting the proper agent could transform how we think about health monitoring and result in saved lives and reduced injuries.<br/><br/>The main goal of this project is to leverage the large amounts of health data that can be collected while driving via machine learning, in order to detect subtle changes in behavior due to out-of-control ADHD symptoms that can, for example, indicate the onset of episodes of inattention before they happen. Via lab-based driving simulator as well as on-road studies, the research team will investigate the individualized behaviors and patterns in vehicle control behaviors that are characteristic of ADHD patients under various states of medication usage. The team will develop a machine learning framework based on case-based and context-based reasoning to match the current driving behavior of the patient with previously recorded driving behavior corresponding to different ADHD symptoms. The key machine learning challenge is to define appropriate similarity measures to compare driving behavior that take into account the key distinctive features of ADHD driving behavior identified during our study. The team will evaluate the accuracy with which the proposed approach can identify and distinguish between different out-of-control ADHD symptoms, which are the implications for long-term handling of ADHD patients, via driving simulator experiments as well as using instrumented cars with real patients.",Massachusetts General Hospital,,,2/1/2259,"$1,845,765.00 "

Current diagnosis of SDB is performed in hospital sleep laboratories by monitoring patients with a host of cardiorespiratory sensors attached at various positions on the patient?s body. This obtrusive form of monitoring is inconvenient to patients and require tremendous amount of attention from technicians to ensure study quality. Children, especially, tolerate the study very poorly; often removing sensors, having trouble sleeping, and necessitating repeat investigations. This project aims to develop a new method to remotely and continuously monitor breathing volume and breathing patterns of human subjects during sleep studies using optical signals assisted by radio frequency signals.

An expected outcome is a robust and accurate breathing volume monitoring system for SDB studies. The cooperation between each of the proposed devices allows us to exploit the synergistic effects of the devices to cover the limitations imposed by each device type and provides system redundancies. These redundancies ensure reliability for long-term monitoring tasks, which are critical for clinical applications. Our proposed research will make the following key contributions to enable new non-contact vital signal monitoring system: (1) Analytical models, experimental tools, and evaluation results of a breathing volume estimation method using a vision-based system (VVE) which include 4D volumetric model and skeletal structure analysis from depth- CO2-thermal (DCT) camera outputs.

Robotic medical diagnosis and surgery offers significant benefits both to the patient by minimizing damage and hence reducing recovery time, and to the clinician by enhancing his/her operation accuracy, dexterity, and efficiency. A main challenge in these robotic procedures is the lack of real-time, full-color, true three-dimensional (3-D) endoscopic imaging with good spatial resolution, large field of view and low cost. Mature 3-D imaging technologies, such as Computed Tomography (CT), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), and ultrasound, take time to complete and process, rendering them impractical in most real-time clinical procedures. Stereo-vision microscopic cameras similar to sensors in Microsoft Kinect can be adopted to generate 3-D endoscope images, but the depth resolution and field of view are severely limited due to the endoscope's small physical dimensions. Further, a stereo-vision camera can only create the perception of 3-D depth in the clinician's brain, but cannot reconstruct a true 3-D image. The latter is needed to match the real-time 3-D image to the ones acquired before the procedure by other methods (CT or MRI) and guide the clinician to identify the anatomy and locate the point of interest.

Beyond the enormous economic impact, they often lead to loss of work productivity, marked decrease in quality of life and disability. A shift from reactive to proactive management of the disease is necessary to improve outcomes and reduce costs, yet clinicians have few tools at their disposal that can help prognosticate which patients are at greatest risk for decline. Decision making is particularly challenging in conditions where large heterogeneity is present in the way the disease might present itself. Simultaneously, due to the rapid proliferation of electronic clinical data stores such as Electronic Health Records and Patient Registries, longitudinal electronic health data (EHD), containing the multitude of clinical measurements taken during routine clinical visits, are becoming available at scale for retrospective analysis. These data provide an unprecedented opportunity to learn about canonical patterns of variability between individuals in the way a disease manifests, and develop novel approaches for individualizing risk prediction. Traditional clinical risk prediction tools do not exploit the richness -- the diversity, complexity and heterogeneity -- of EHD. This project proposes a novel computational framework for individualized risk prediction from modern electronic health data sources.<br/><br/>This project develops a flexible Bayesian framework for jointly modeling the array of complex measurements present in the electronic health record to track an individual's disease status over time. Towards this, the framework addresses challenges due to missingness and noise in the measurement process, inherent in EHD. In addition, this proposal demonstrates the framework on data collected from large scale population databases over two decades for two different disease groups. This proposal will significantly advance computational modeling for individualized risk prediction from modern electronic health data sources.

Non-pharmacological interventions provided by caregivers (e.g., distraction, providing rest, calming the environment, speaking softly, gentle touch, favorite music selections, etc.) can reduce the frequency and severity of agitation in PWD. However, agitation can be unpredictable and influenced by the environment, and early signs of agitation often go undetected and can escalate to aggressive agitation that is more difficult to manage. As a result, most methods used to deal with agitation in dementia are reactive rather than proactive and are administered too late in an agitation escalation to be effective. A tool to predict agitation episodes and detect early stages of agitation would empower caregivers to intervene early and ultimately reduce agitation, thus reducing caregiver burden and extending aging-in-place and the associated quality-of-life and cost benefits. This caregiver empowerment based strategy to PWD care could have a significant impact on the ability of PWD to age-in-place. Community outreach efforts will be conducted that engage PWD and their caregivers throughout the project, and the resulting knowledge products can be disseminated to a range of stakeholders across various sociocultural ecosystems, from researchers to family members and respite providers. The project rests on the practice of universal access, demonstrating a design that is beneficial to and accessible by the broadest range of user groups. This project will also establish a framework for a collaborative approach between engineers, clinicians, and the caregiving community to address critical healthcare needs, which will be the basis of new course modules and conference workshops.<br/><br/>This project will overcome the fundamental scientific barriers to realizing such a tool with a three-phase research plan to employ Behavioral and Environmental Sensing and Intervention. First, a system of body-worn and in-home sensors will be developed to provide continuous, non-invasive agitation assessment and environmental context monitoring. Second, this system will be deployed in the homes of community-dwelling PWD to model the relationship between agitation and the environment and to identify features of early-stage agitation, both of which will inform the development of real-time caregiver notification strategies. Third, proof-of-concept for will be demonstrated through a human subject pilot study, with caregivers receiving real-time notifications to alter the environment in advance of probable agitation episodes and to administer PWD interventions in the early stages of agitation. Successful completion of this 3-phase project will motivate a follow-up large-scale proof-of-practice study.The investigative team combines expertise in technology function (computer engineering), accessibility (human centered design), and applicability (medical research and clinical care) to address fundamental challenges of multimodal sensing system-of-systems, modeling cyber-socio-physical system dynamics, and real-time notifications - all within the context of a critical societal need. Diverse sensor streams will be aggregated by fusing assorted data types across multiple time scales, aggregated data will be analyzed using novel agitation assessment and environmental characterization methods, extracted information will be used to develop dynamic system models, and customized automated notifications will empower caregivers to intervene before agitation escalation - all while meeting real-time intervention requirements. These models will be PWD-caregiver dyad specific, requiring dynamic in-situ training, and will present new ontologies for cyber-socio-physical systems that incorporate contexts, technologies, and social dyads to predict and mitigate disruptive neurological events.

About 700,000 people die annually in US hospitals and 16% of them were diagnosed with sepsis (including a high prevalence of severe sepsis with major  complication). In addition to being deadly, sepsis is the most expensive condition associated with in-hospital stay, resulting in a 75% longer stay than any other condition.  The total burden of sepsis to the US healthcare system is estimated to be $20.3 billion, most of which is paid by Medicare and Medicaid. In fact, in June 2015 the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) reported that sepsis accounted for over $7 billion in Medicare payments (second only to major joint replacement), a close to 10% increase from the previous year.  This pervasive drain on health care resources is due, in part, to difficulties in diagnosis and delayed treatment. For example, every one hour delay in treatment of severe sepsis/shock with antibiotics decreases a patient's survival probability by 10%. Many of these deaths could have been averted or postponed if a better system of care was in place. The goal of this research is to overcome these barriers by integrating electronic health records (EHR) and clinical expertise to provide an evidence-based framework to diagnose and accurately risk-stratify patients within the sepsis spectrum, and develop and validate intervention policies that inform sepsis treatment decisions.  The  project to bring together health care providers, researchers, educators, and students to add value to patient care by integrating machine learning, decision analytical models, human factors analysis, as well as system and process modeling to advance scientific knowledge, predict sepsis, and prevent sepsis-related health deterioration.

The team will 1) identify important factors that uncover patient profiles based on Bayesian exponential family principal components analysis; 2) develop hidden Markov models (HMMs) and input-output HMMs to identify clusters of patients with similar progression patterns within the sepsis spectrum; 3) provide an analytical framework to support sepsis staging in clinical practice using bilevel optimization. They will 1) predict short- and long-term individual patient outcomes using multivariate statistical models and simulation; 2) develop semi-Markov decision process and partially observable semi-Markov decision process models to identify timing of therapeutic actions and diagnostic tests.

One limitation to effective disaster response is easy and rapid access to diverse information about available resources, community resource needs, baseline and current environmental conditions. This project aims to expand access to environmental and drinking water quality disaster response and recovery data in a publicly available format using a widely used collaborative online sharing platform named HydroShare.   Curating a central repository of assembled data has the potential to greatly facilitate coordinated disaster responses of all types, and improve the monitoring of the recovery process. The project team will prototype this system with an assessment of drinking water, environment, and public health concerns unique to Puerto Rico in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria. By working directly with public water utilities, the project team intends to characterize and map the severity of impaired water resources and distribution systems in Puerto Rico, inform communities about how to protect themselves against hazards specific to their water, and to contribute to rebuilding so the nation is better prepared for future hurricanes. Developing cyber and social infrastructure to understand the dynamics of drinking water contamination after natural disasters will improve disaster preparedness and response, and contribute to efforts across the nation and the world to build for a resilient future.<br/><br/>Recovery efforts from natural disasters can be more efficient with data-driven information on current needs and future risks. This project aims to advance open-source software infrastructure to support scientific investigation and data-driven decision making with a prototype system using a water quality assessment developed to investigate post-Hurricane Maria drinking water contamination in Puerto Rico. The widespread disruption of water treatment processes and uncertain drinking water quality within distribution systems in Puerto Rico poses risk to human health. However, there is no existing digital infrastructure to scientifically determine the impacts of the hurricane to inform a response to the crisis. After every natural disaster, including hurricane Maria, elementary questions on how to provide high quality water supplies and support basic human health are difficult to answer.  This project will archive and make accessible data on environmental variables unique to Puerto Rico and Hurricane Maria, damage caused by the storm, and will begin to address time sensitive needs of citizens. By working directly with drinking water utilities to collect samples of biological and inorganic drinking water quality, this project aims to generate understanding and awareness of the degree to which drinking water systems were impacted by Hurricane Maria and the status of drinking water infrastructure and emergency recovery in Puerto Rico after the storm. The goal of this project is to advance understanding of how the severity of a hazard to human health (e.g., no access to safe culinary water) is related to the sophistication, connectivity, and operations of the physical and related digital infrastructure systems. By rapidly collecting data in the early stages of recovery, the team plans to test the design of an integrated cyberinfrastructure system to increase the accessibility of environmental and health data for understanding the impacts from hurricane-related natural disasters.

For many such conditions, early diagnosis is the key for successful intervention and maximized wellness, and accurate mobility assessment is central to monitoring progression and evaluating the impact of physical and pharmaceutical therapies.  In recent years, inertial body sensor networks (BSNs) have emerged as platforms with the potential to provide continuous, non-invasive collection of high-precision motion data in any location over an extended period of time.  Up to now these have been used primarily in-clinic, making absolute assessments from data collected challenging. Out-of-clinic collections introduce nuisance variables, which exacerbate the problem.

While there is no broad agreement on the potential solutions, structural reform is on the horizon. The meaningful use of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) is seen as a key to improving efficiency.   Technology solutions including miniaturized implantable medical devices, networked home monitoring devices, and the ubiquitous use of smart phones are starting to enable continuous real-time monitoring of patients as they go about their daily lives. Rich data from these devices form an electronic Personal Health Record (PHR) that captures patient health in a much finer time-scale than the EHR.

This proposal puts forth a comprehensive and systematic approach to intelligently process such data aiming at preventing hospitalization, empowering patients to actively participate in managing their health, assessing quality of care, and facilitating cost-effective epidemiology in the emerging data-rich environment.  In the proposed framework, early risk assessment starts with algorithms for mining EHR and PHR data to classify patients in terms of the risk they have for developing an acute condition that would require hospitalization and/or incur large costs. Risk stratification produced by our approach triggers a set of actions, including tests, additional and more intensive monitoring, and physician involvement. As part of this dynamic health management process, patients can have access to tools that enable their active participation in the daily management of chronic conditions, such as diabetes.

These sensors along with the wires are a hindrance to the clinical care. In addition, the existing system cannot be used for home environments because of the size and cost. While there is an abundance of physiological signals streaming across NICU monitoring systems, it is challenging for clinicians caring for preterm infants to determine pathological states, as there is no method available to translate these signals into validated indices to define pathology. The primary objective of this proposed research is to explore whether a dedicated compact device with wearable biosensors along with wireless networks can be built for the detection and anticipation of life threatening events in infants in both NICU and home environments. The secondary objective is to explore whether computational tools that provide real-time indices of cardio-respiratory risk can be developed to assist clinicians for neonatal care.

Mobile sensors (embedded in phones, vehicles, wearables, and the environment) continuously capture data in great detail, and have the potential to address problems in a range of scientific and engineering domains.  This effort focuses upon a specific case -- health data -- that builds upon several capabilities developed in National Institutes of Health (NIH) sponsored projects for assembling and analyzing health data collected through mobile sensors and apps.  Improvements to the usefulness of extremely noisy, distributed data can serve many communities, and the components are extensible outside the human health domain.  <br/><br/>Mobile sensors present a distinct set of data challenges: the data quantity and quality fluctuate, and uncertainty can be high.  Establishing provenance on such noisy data is a challenge, and there are limitations on access to data from human subjects.  This project addresses several of the distinctive challenges associated with mobile sensor data.   Variability is addressed by providing detailed annotation with metadata (such as provenance and quality), and by providing facilities for context-specific reasoning about the metadata.  The system captures provenance metadata along with data in a stream, and propagates this information alongside derived data from one stage to the next.  This creates cyberinfrastructure that makes it possible to 'replay' mobile device data with different configurations, to comparatively benchmark two algorithms or to diagnose erroneous output.  The project builds upon the capabilities and success of the NIH-funded Center of Excellence in Mobile Sensor Data to Knowledge (MD2K), which provides an open-source cyberinfrastructure enabling the collection, curation, analysis, visualization, and interpretation of high-frequency mobile sensor data.  Conducting research with mobile sensor data collected by others continues to be challenging; this project develops a companion open-source provenance cyberinfrastructure, facilitating the sharing of the mobile sensor data itself.  Results include metadata standards, interfaces, and runtime support for annotating data streams with the source (sensor, location, sampling rate, continuous or episodic), semantics of output (number, probability, class), provenance (features, rules for decision), and validation (specificity, sensitivity, benchmark used).  The infrastructure accommodates a wide variety of data types and enables data discovery, analytics, visualization, integration, and validation by third party researchers. The project improves the ability of the wider scientific and engineering community to use mobile sensing systems and metadata, and it also has immediate, tangible societal benefits in health and wellness.  <br/><br/>This award by the Advanced Cyberinfrastructure Division is jointly supported by the NSF Directorate for Computer & Information Science & Engineering (Division of Computer and Network Systems, and Division of Information and Intelligent Systems).",University of California-Riverside,,,8/31/2022,"$1,200,000.00 "

This project aims to advance open-source software infrastructure to support scientific investigation and data-driven decision making with a prototype system using a water quality assessment developed to investigate post-Hurricane Maria drinking water contamination in Puerto Rico. The widespread disruption of water treatment processes and uncertain drinking water quality within distribution systems in Puerto Rico poses risk to human health. However, there is no existing digital infrastructure to scientifically determine the impacts of the hurricane to inform a response to the crisis.

By working directly with drinking water utilities to collect samples of biological and inorganic drinking water quality, this project aims to generate understanding and awareness of the degree to which drinking water systems were impacted by Hurricane Maria and the status of drinking water infrastructure and emergency recovery in Puerto Rico after the storm. The goal of this project is to advance understanding of how the severity of a hazard to human health (e.g., no access to safe culinary water) is related to the sophistication, connectivity, and operations of the physical and related digital infrastructure systems.

To address these challenges, this project develops a comprehensive set of machine learning methods that can be broadly applied to a variety of problems. Data sources include both in-patient bedside data as well as remotely monitored telemedicine data, thus connecting data at multiple levels for specific patient populations. This research is crucial to support the development of pilot computational models for stratification of critical care patients and potentially inform ways to reduce the overall healthcare and societal costs for this patient population.<br/><br/>The project aims to develop novel computational algorithms for reliably stratifying brain injury patients and predicting their short-term and long-term outcomes from multi-modal physiologic and clinical data.

There is mounting evidence that EHRs are a rich resource for clinical research, but they are notoriously difficult to leverage because of their orientation to healthcare business operations, heterogeneity across commercial systems, and high levels of missing or erroneous entries. Moreover, the interactions among different data sources within an EHR are challenging to model, hampering our ability to leverage traditional analytic frameworks. In recognition of this problem, various efforts have been undertaken to transform EHR data into concise and meaningful concepts, or phenotypes. Yet, to date, these efforts have been ad hoc and labor intensive, resulting in specific phenotypes for specific environments; e.g., type 2 diabetes in the EHR system at Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC). There is an urgent need for scalable phenotyping methods, but several major challenges must be addressed, including: a) patient representation, b) high-throughput phenotype generation from EHRs, c) expert-guided phenotype refinement, and d) phenotype adaptation across institutions. The goal of this project is to address these challenges by developing a general computational framework for transforming EHR data into meaningful phenotypes with only modest levels of expert guidance.

Vascular occlusion is the primary cause of various clinical complications and shortened lifespan. The developed method will provide rapid blood testing in a minimally-invasive manner. Specifically, a quantitative measurement of cell sickling that is a primary contributing factor of vascular occlusion will be made. This project will open up new opportunities to gather large quantities of longitudinal cell sickling data to be associated with clinical outcomes and to help establish criteria for prediction of pain crises in individual SCD patients. Alerts will be raised when the measured cell sickling level is higher than the patient's ""normal"" range, allowing quicker interventions to prevent further complications and pain crises.

Developing cyber and social infrastructure to understand the dynamics of drinking water contamination after natural disasters will improve disaster preparedness and response, and contribute to efforts across the nation and the world to build for a resilient future.<br/><br/>Recovery efforts from natural disasters can be more efficient with data-driven information on current needs and future risks. This project aims to advance open-source software infrastructure to support scientific investigation and data-driven decision making with a prototype system using a water quality assessment developed to investigate post-Hurricane Maria drinking water contamination in Puerto Rico. The widespread disruption of water treatment processes and uncertain drinking water quality within distribution systems in Puerto Rico poses risk to human health. However, there is no existing digital infrastructure to scientifically determine the impacts of the hurricane to inform a response to the crisis. After every natural disaster, including hurricane Maria, elementary questions on how to provide high quality water supplies and support basic human health are difficult to answer.  This project will archive and make accessible data on environmental variables unique to Puerto Rico and Hurricane Maria, damage caused by the storm, and will begin to address time sensitive needs of citizens. By working directly with drinking water utilities to collect samples of biological and inorganic drinking water quality, this project aims to generate understanding and awareness of the degree to which drinking water systems were impacted by Hurricane Maria and the status of drinking water infrastructure and emergency recovery in Puerto Rico after the storm. The goal of this project is to advance understanding of how the severity of a hazard to human health (e.g., no access to safe culinary water) is related to the sophistication, connectivity, and operations of the physical and related digital infrastructure systems. By rapidly collecting data in the early stages of recovery, the team plans to test the design of an integrated cyberinfrastructure system to increase the accessibility of environmental and health data for understanding the impacts from hurricane-related natural disasters. The team will test and stress the CUAHSI HydroShare data publication mechanisms and capabilities to (1) assess the spatial and temporal presence of waterborne pathogens in public water systems impacted by a natural disaster, (2) demonstrate usability of HydroShare as a clearinghouse to centralize selected datasets related to Hurricane Maria, and (3) develop a prototype cyberinfrastructure to assess environmental conditions and public health impacted by natural disasters. By rapidly collecting data in the early stages of recovery, The team plans to test the design of an integrated cyberinfrastructure system to increase the accessibility of environmental and health data for understanding the impacts from hurricane-related natural disasters.  This work will develop a prototype of a software infrastructure system to advance understanding of how data-driven information can reduce the impacts of natural disaster and serve as a platform for future research. The project thus serves to not only document post-disaster conditions, but develops a process to track the impact of recovery over time, as monitored through health, power availability and water quality.",University of Tennessee Knoxville,,,9/1/2142,"$1,015,763.00 "

Drug-drug interactions (DDIs), a major cause of adverse drug events (ADEs), are a serious global health concern, and a severe detriment to public health. The scale of DDIs involving three or more drugs (also called high-order DDIs) has posed a prohibitory challenge for its molecular pharmacology and clinical research, which motivates alternative strategies such as mining health record data. This project aims to develop large-scale computational strategies and effective software tools for mining high-order DDI effects from health record databases, in order to yield novel discoveries in drug safety, and ultimately to benefit national health and well being.<br/><br/> <br/>To achieve the above goal, this project is designed to complete four specific tasks. Task 1 aims to develop a novel statistical framework to discover high-order DDI signals associated with ADEs from health record databases. Task 2 aims to study a novel drug safety problem for mining directional DDI signals. Task 3 aims to develop an innovative approach for mining directional DDI patterns at the drug-group level. Task 4 is devoted to software development, evaluation and validation. The project applies these methods to analyze three independent databases, packages method implementations into a user-friendly software toolkit, and releases the toolkit to the public. This project not only facilitates the development of novel computational techniques in drug safety research, but also addresses emerging scientific questions in modeling, mining, and visual exploration of complex data such as the health record data.

Difficulties arise in finding the proper dose for drugs that have a narrow therapeutic range, high toxicity, altered effects with disease progression, or those that are affected by genomic factors. Because of these complexities, physicians often rely on trial-and-error-like approaches to determine optimal drug doses for individual subjects. Unfortunately, these approaches may lead to over- and under- dosing, resulting in subtherapeutic effect or increased risk of adverse events. Advances in engineering and computational intelligence may help to alleviate much of the uncertainty when dosing these agents. To address the complexities in individualized drug dose, this EAGER research aims to investigate a new methodology for the development of individualized patient models and a novel control approach for personalized drug dosing. In the short term, this effort will impact the treatment of anemia, a common chronic condition in hemodialysis patients. The successful completion of the proposed research, however, has the potential to result in a new method for personalized drug dosing that can be applicable to many other chronically administered drugs that require some type of monitoring. On the educational front, plans include training graduate students and involving undergraduate students with research. Several existing programs such as INSPIRE and the High School Outreach Program will be used to reach out to high school students. Outcomes of the project will be made available online.<br/><br/>The objective of this EAGER project is to investigate a novel approach to individualized drug dosing using a new modern control method based on Radial Basis Functions (RBF) and robust patient-specific models. The project has the following three specific aims: 1) The theoretical principles of semi-blind robust system identification are examined to produce individual patient models from a limited number of noisy patient-specific clinical data. In contrast to classical identification techniques, robust system identification takes into account system uncertainties, unmodeled dynamics and model complexity, i.e., there is no assumption on the model order, uncertainties and noise affecting data. 2) Based on the these predictive individualized models, the development of a patient-specific dosing approach using a novel RBF-Galerkin controller is proposed to generate optimal dosing sequence and expected response adapting to temporal changes in patients' dose-response characteristics. 3) The new method will be evaluated in silico using a test case, derived from previously collected clinical data: Erythropoietin (EPO) dosing for anemia management. This is a clinically relevant test-bed as the administration of drug EPO is intensively monitored, has narrow therapeutic range and can have serious adverse effects. Following successful in silico evaluation of the proposed method, a validation study will be performed at the University of Louisville controlled hemodialysis unit. As a benchmark we will use existing state-of-the art approaches to anemia management as well. Successful application of the proposed technique to this agent will provide proof-of-concept that the proposed method can be applicable in clinics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",University of California-Berkeley,,,8/31/2021,"$943,832.00 "

There is no cure, and medications can only provide symptomatic relief. In addition, costs associated with PD, including treatment, social security payments, and lost income from inability to work, is estimated to be nearly $25 billion per year in the United States alone. The current state-of-the-art in PD management suffers from several shortcomings: (1) frequent clinic visits are a major contributor to the high cost of PD treatment and are inconvenient for the patient, especially in a population for which traveling is difficult; (2) inaccurate patient self-reports and 15-20 minute clinic visits are not enough information for doctors to accurately assess their patients, leading to difficulties in monitoring patient symptoms and medication response; and (3) motor function assessments are subjective, making it difficult to monitor disease progression. Furthermore, because they must be performed by a trained clinician, it is infeasible to do frequent motor function assessments. This project aims to promote a paradigm shift in PD management through in-home monitoring using wearable accelerometers and machine learning. Novel algorithms and experimental protocols are developed to allow for robust detection and assessment of PD motor symptoms during daily living environments.  <br/><br/>Specifically, this project develops algorithms for weakly-supervised learning, time series analysis, and personalization of classifiers. In previous studies, data was collected in controlled environments for a short amount of time (1-4 hours) and manually labeled for fully-supervised learning. In contrast, this project collects long-term (several weeks), in-home data where the participants' actions are natural and unscripted. Participants use a cell phone app to label their own data, marking segments of time as containing or not containing the occurrence of a PD motor symptom. Since the exact time of the symptom is unknown, this constitutes weakly-labeled data. This project extends multiple-instance learning algorithms for learning from weakly-labeled data in time series. Additional major technical challenges include detection of subtle motor symptoms and local minima during optimization. To further increase robustness and generalization, this project explores the use of personalization algorithms to learn person-specific models of motor symptoms from unsupervised data. The proposed techniques for weakly-supervised learning and personalization are general, and they can be applied to other human sensing problems.",University of Iowa,,,9/3/2259,"$925,477.00 "

This approach addresses the problem of physiological monitoring today that requires skin contacts such as electrodes for ECG, and hence cannot scale to widespread monitoring of patients and healthy adults for years. The key challenge is to develop high-resolution sensing on low-power mobile platforms that can separate out the weak motion signals of heart and lung, from the gross motion of the body and the sensor. The project is developing theory and design for a compressive ultrawideband (UWB) RF sensor that achieves two orders of magnitude reduction in the required sampling rate to make it feasible to realize in a low-power mobile form factor. EasySense employs dynamic compressive sensing algorithms to improve the quality of sensing through temporal integration of information and employs interference subspace cancelation methods to cancel out motion artifacts using data obtained from accelerometers and gyroscopes. The project is implementing all the needed hardware, firmware, embedded software on the sensor node for sampling, processing, and wireless communication, and mobile phone software for data collection, storage, and visualization. EasySense is evaluated against traditional physiological sensors via lab and field studies on human subjects involving stress and exercise protocols.<br/> <br/>By realizing contactless sensing of physiology in the field environment, EasySense will enable long-term physiological monitoring at large-scale that is essential for determining potential causes and early biomarkers of fatal diseases of slow accumulation such as cancer and cardiovascular diseases.

Family caregivers often report increased anxiety and depression, and many forego their own health needs as the demands of being a family caregiver are sustained over many years. It is also known that poor interactions between patient and caregiver increase the difficulty of providing care. Monitoring reactivity between patient and caregiver could signal when problematic interactions might occur. Just-in-time or even predictive recommendations in those moments could improve these interactions and reduce strain on caregivers. This project develops a monitoring, modeling, and interactive recommendation solution (for caregivers) for in-home dementia patient care that focuses on caregiver-patient relationships. This includes monitoring for mood and stress and analyzing the significance of monitoring those attributes to dementia patient care and subsequent behavior dynamics between patient and caregiver. In addition, novel and adaptive behavioral suggestions at the right moments aim at helping improve familial interactions related to caregiving, which over time should ameliorate the stressful effects of the patient's illness and decrease strain on caregivers. This work could also benefit nursing homes and assisted living facilities by improving care for their residents, and could be useful for other caregiving situations, including the care of children with emotional/behavioral challenges who are cared for at home by their families.

Stroke is the leading cause of disability among older adults in the United States. More than 800,000 strokes occur each year and nearly one third of all stroke survivors have significant residual disability, with older individuals generally experiencing slower functional recovery. Current physical rehabilitation of such patients is primarily hospital centric. However, due to economic pressures on the U.S. health care system, stroke patients are receiving less therapy and going home after few months of acute therapy without regaining the whole functionality of their body. Moreover, many patients who have completed their acute in-patient rehabilitation following a stroke or other injury may have limited access to out-patient rehabilitation upon their return home. These patients can benefit from access and quality of care through home-based rehabilitations. The success of the home-based therapy is highly dependent on monitoring the patient compliance and designing the home-based rehabilitation that can mentally engaged the subjects. The proposed research approaches the above stated problem with two novel propositions by developing a haptic-based rehabilitation system that can be used at home. <br/><br/>The project is carried out as follows: First, a haptic home-based system is developed to rehabilitate Activity of Daily Living (ADL) skills in both the affected and the non-dominant/unaffected upper limb of a patient whose dominant upper limbs has been affected by some disability. Second, the research investigates the use of home centered cognitive haptic therapy by monitoring the patient's brain activity. The proposed system uses cognitive and haptic feedbacks to monitor the progress of patient and his or her engagement and adapts itself accordingly. Patient's recovery progress is evaluated through combination of 1) scores related to accuracy and completion of task and 2) subject's level of mental engagement during treatment at home. This evaluation empowers the physician to monitor the subject's performance during in-home therapy and allow him/her to adjust the haptic and simulation in an appropriate fashion. This research hypothesizes that by using haptics the effectiveness of home-centered rehabilitation therapy is effective in empowering the patient. Moreover, it is contemplated that by cognitive monitoring of subjects, it is possible to evaluate and improve patient engagement during the therapy sessions.",SUNY at Stony Brook,,,5/3/2134,"$843,462.00 "

Because mobility impairments in early life can have long-term effects on psychological as well as physical development, it is important both to help children overcome these impairments through assistive technologies and to be able to measure the effect of interventions in everyday movements over long periods of time. However, most assistive and sensing technologies are bulky and uncomfortable. The project team will develop soft, low-profile sensing and actuating technologies that look and feel like everyday clothing. The wearable systems will be developed and evaluated with a group of 3-12 year old children and their caregivers. This work will contribute to the development of technologies that enable understanding and effects of interventions on mobility impairments, and contribute to the burgeoning smart textiles and clothing industry in the USA.  <br/><br/><br/>The approach relies on stitched, textile-based sensing and a hybrid approach of soft inflatable structures and shape-memory fibers to assist limb movements. Learning based activity recognition algorithms will be developed that are robust to differences in body shape and garment-movement error. The atypical movements performed by children with mobility impairments will be recognized, enabling assessment of clinical indicators like range of movement. The actuating component of the proposed system uses soft pneumatic structures to provide counter-gravitational (lift) forces, and Shape Memory Alloy (SMA) spring-type actuators to provide directional control. The system will be developed in two phases: initially, the sensing component and the passive lift (inflatable abduction support) will be developed using typically-developing children, and tested in 4-week in-home trials with 15 children with mobility impairments. The active actuated system will be developed and deployed in collaboration with 5-10 families with children with mobility impairments over a period of one year.

This project will use an integrated autonomous system that consists of a mobile robot and smart insole sensors to assist older adults to independently live in their own homes and interact with their communities.  The system will have two initial goals: supporting exercise and enhancing social connections. The target exercise is walking, the most preferred and accessible exercise modality among older adults. Regular walking exercises may result in enhanced balance, increased muscle strength, and reduced risk of falling.  The system guides individuals in regular walking exercises, autonomously assesses gait states, and provides real-time personalized feedback to engage older adults into the exercise. The robot will also be used to connect older adults with family and friends through a virtual connection. The project team will evaluate the system at a senior center in New York City using objective and subjective performance criteria measuring older adults' experiences with the system. This project serves the national interest because the integrated social assistive robot and wearable sensor system enhances mobility and social connectedness of older adults thus should improve their health and well-being.

For example, heart failure is a significant source of mortality within the U.S; it is responsible for 1% of all emergency room presentations and contributes to one in every nine deaths. A significant proportion of heart failure patients have concurrent conduction system disease, which will lead to their eventual death. Cardiac resynchronization has proven to be a useful therapy for improving cardiac function as well as reducing mortality in some patients. However, a significant number of patients fail to respond to resynchronization therapy, often due to inadequate pacemaker lead placement. There currently exists no pacemaker system that provides the 'potential' benefits of multisite temporally and spatially precise pacing for resynchronization. To reach the audacious goal of eliminating cardiovascular diseases, new technologies must be developed that will monitor the diseased heart with unprecedented temporal and spatial precision and will manage the pacing of the heart to restore a healthy function of the heart. This project will process data recorded from multiple sites and will generate a pacing therapy specific to the patient in real-time.<br/><br/>The award revisits the core foundation of pacemakers to develop temporally and spatially precise pacing at multiple sites for resynchronization. The researchers will develop a robust, well-annotated database of intra-cardiac electrograms (IEGM) from multiple cardiac sites. The focus will be on identifying challenging cases that are clinically difficult to differentiate and, thus, stand to reap the greatest benefit of being able to direct overall algorithm development. This information will be added to the associated metadata file. Data will be collected from a minimum of 150 patients with at least 50 patients from each identified pathophysiology. Pathology of each patient based on data from multiple intra-cardiac recording sites will be identified. The proposed machine-learning pipeline explores the representation of time series using wavelets and then learns transformations of multiple time series using the Lie group framework. This pipeline clusters time-series data to identify the right pathology for the specific patient.

Early diagnosis is critically important for successful treatment, and can prevent most cases of blindness. However, lack of access to expert medical diagnosis and care, especially in rural areas, remains a growing healthcare challenge. In addition, clinical expertise in ROP is lacking, and medical professionals are struggling to meet the increasing need for ROP care. As point-of-care technologies for diagnosis and intervention are rapidly expanding, the potential ability to assess ROP severity from any location with an internet connection and a camera, even without immediate ophthalmologic consultation available, could significantly improve delivery of ROP care by identifying infants who are in most urgent need for referral and treatment. This would dramatically reduce the incidence of blindness without a proportionate increase in the need for human resources, which take many years to develop.<br/><br/>This project develops a prototype assistive integrative support tool for ROP, featuring a modular design comprising: (a) image analysis, (b) information fusion of clinical, imaging, and diagnostic data, and (c) generative probabilistic and regression models with associated computationally efficient machine learning algorithms. The outcomes of the project include disease severity metrics and diagnostic estimates obtained through clinical evidence classifiers trained jointly over expert-generated labels. These labels consist of discrete diagnostic labels, as well as comparison outcomes of relative severity between pairs of images. Random process models for vessel tortuosity and diameter distributions over the retina, as well as patch-based vessel-free image analysis through the use of convolutional neural networks on the entire image, enhance and augment feature extraction. Moreover, incorporating severity comparison outcomes through novel hard and soft constraint methods force inferred severity to agree with ordinal information provided by experts and address inherent uncertainty in expert ground-truth labels.

This project addresses three key problems. First, how well can smartphones sensors support real-time monitoring and prediction of the scale of an infectious disease (in this case Ebola) compared to stochastic epidemiology models? Second, how can smartphone communications be used to educate a population about prophylactic behaviors and change such behaviors?

Wellbeing monitoring leveraging existing WiFi infrastructure is particularly attractive as it requires neither wearing body instrumentation nor active monitorng by the user. Such an approach would facilitate a broad range of healthcare related applications at home environments without frequent hospital visits, such as real-time prediction and prevention of certain health problems (e.g., cardiovascular diseases and sleep apnea).

Though useful, its highly personalized and labor-intensive nature makes the cost of effective health coaching prohibitive for many underserved populations that could benefit significantly from it. This project will develop a virtual health coaching system that learns from human health coach demonstrations to interact with patients via the smart message system (SMS) to set appropriate health goals that are Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and Timely (SMART). The virtual coach will become progressively more independent, but will not be fully autonomous for two reasons: first, at this stage of research, one cannot trust the system to always send appropriate messages when it encounters unique situations; second, the virtual coach would not substitute, but supplement/collaborate with a human coach.

New technologies are needed to enable in-home monitoring and treatment of patients at risk of developing acute decompensated heart failure. Early symptom detection will help clinicians reduce disease progression and prevent hospitalization. Current home-based management relies on monitoring weight gain, but weight alone does not accurately gauge the fluid accumulation that predicts worsening of heart failure. Atrial fibrillation, a heart rhythm abnormality associated with stroke, hospitalization, and 2-fold higher risk of death, is also common in heart failure patients. Because atrial fibrillation symptoms can be vague, intermittent, and short lasting, atrial fibrillation detection requires continuous monitoring--a challenge in ambulatory patients. A device that can measure vital signs (including heart rate, respiration rate, and tidal volume), intrathoracic fluid status (using thoracic bioimpedance) and heart rhythm will both detect atrial fibrillation and promote quick and accurate identification of the early stages of acute decompensation in chronic heart failure patients.  Thus, the goal of this work is to develop a novel device for in-home monitoring of heart failure patients who are at risk of developing acute decompensated heart failure.  The system will consist of a bioimpedance monitor (a wearable vest with dry electrodes--no adhesives, gels or wetting required) to detect trending to acute decompensated heart failure and of a smart-watch to measure atrial fibrillation. These components will require the development of novel sensor and information technologies, wearable monitors, signal processing algorithms, and telecommunication systems. The long-term goal of this project is to enable in-home monitoring of patients at risk of catastrophic cardiovascular events in order to provide prompt, targeted intervention, reduce symptom progression and avert preventable hospitalization. A wireless cardiac monitoring system that will be comfortable to wear, easy to use, cost effective, and feasible for home use with ambulatory patients will be developed. The system will provide patients and their healthcare providers with early warnings about cardiac decompensation and serious but difficult-to-detect arrhythmias, which can empower patients and caregivers, improve quality of life, and reduce health care costs.<br/><br/>This project aims to: 1) develop reuseable carbon-black and polydimethylsiloxane (CB/PDMS) electrodes that capture bioimpedance and electrocardiogram data; 2) develop hardware and algorithms for acute decompensated heart failure detection, resulting in a wearable monitor with embedded CB/PDMS electrodes; 3) develop hardware and algorithms for atrial fibrillation detection using a smart watch; and 4) evaluate the performance and usability of both detection systems in a prospectively recruited cohort study. The clinical study will target populations, including patients with psychosocial or cognitive limitations, that are at high risk for acute decompensated heart failure and atrial fibrillation progression but that typically are omitted from clinical studies.  The central hypothesis is that an innovative bioimpedance monitor with re-usable, non-wetted bioimpedance electrodes embedded in a wearable vest device used in conjunction with a smart watch will continuously collect and transmit key physiologic data. Devices running decision-support algorithms will analyze this data to identify patients with emergent acute decompensated heart failure symptoms that require prompt attention. A second hypothesis is that a wrist-based continuous monitoring device will provide unobtrusive and acceptable 24-hour heart rhythm monitoring and will augment data collected by the bioimpedance monitor. Heart rhythm, vital signs, and intrathoracic fluid accumulation measurements will be collected via 24-hour data recordings.

We propose a multi-disciplinary investigation into a novel systems framework that will empower individuals to adopt permanent lifestyle changes that result in sustained PWM.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: A goal-seeking systems framework that enables the integration of medical protocols and behavioral analysis protocols with emerging technologies and devices is developed in this project. The approach empowers individuals by (a) suggesting actions that they are most likely to perform, (b) ensuring that the resources required for the suggested actions are accessible, (c) reinforcing their desire to achieve the target consequences through incentives, and (d) enabling them to track their personal progress toward their target consequences. The goal-seeking framework seeks to find good-enough solutions and does not require a precise model of the underlying solution. As long as the measured consequences of the selected actions are within an acceptable tolerance limit, the decision-maker allows the system to evolve. The ability to tailor the tolerance limit to an individual, vary the limit over time, and incorporate humans in the decision-making loop all make the approach attractive.

Results will be widely disseminated through traditional academic publications and non-traditional avenues. For example, the team will start a Personalized Wellness column in local community newspapers. Community representatives will be invited to attend project workshops and presentations. The systems-framework that is based on the goal-seeking paradigm has the potential to fundamentally transform current practice in personalized medicine, community psychiatric services delivery, substance-dependence reduction programs, and reducing obesity among K-12 students.

In addition to being deadly, sepsis is the most expensive condition associated with in-hospital stay, resulting in a 75% longer stay than any other condition.  The total burden of sepsis to the US healthcare system is estimated to be $20.3 billion, most of which is paid by Medicare and Medicaid. In fact, in June 2015 the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) reported that sepsis accounted for over $7 billion in Medicare payments (second only to major joint replacement), a close to 10% increase from the previous year.  This pervasive drain on health care resources is due, in part, to difficulties in diagnosis and delayed treatment. For example, every one hour delay in treatment of severe sepsis/shock with antibiotics decreases a patient's survival probability by 10%. Many of these deaths could have been averted or postponed if a better system of care was in place. The goal of this research is to overcome these barriers by integrating electronic health records (EHR) and clinical expertise to provide an evidence-based framework to diagnose and accurately risk-stratify patients within the sepsis spectrum, and develop and validate intervention policies that inform sepsis treatment decisions.  The  project to bring together health care providers, researchers, educators, and students to add value to patient care by integrating machine learning, decision analytical models, human factors analysis, as well as system and process modeling to advance scientific knowledge, predict sepsis, and prevent sepsis-related health deterioration. In addition to the societal impact that clinical translation of these findings may bring, the project will provide engineering and computer science students and health services researchers with cross-disciplinary educational experience.<br/><br/>The proposed research will apply engineering and computer science methodologies to analyze patient level EHR across two large scale health care facilities, Mayo Clinic Rochester and Christiana Care Health System and to inform clinical decision making for sepsis. The multi-institutional, interdisciplinary collaboration will enable the development of health care solutions for sepsis by describing and accurately risk-stratifying hospitalized patients, and developing decision analytical models to personalize and inform diagnostic and treatment decisions considering patient outcomes and response implications. The Sepsis Early Prediction Support Implementation System (S.E.P.S.I.S.) project aims will be to: 1) Develop data-driven models to classify patients according to their clinical progression to diagnose sepsis and predict risk of deterioration, thus informing therapeutic actions. 2) Develop personalized intervention policies for patients within the sepsis spectrum.  3) Develop decision support systems (DSS) for personalized interventions focusing on resource implications and usability within a real hospital setting. The team will 1) identify important factors that uncover patient profiles based on Bayesian exponential family principal components analysis; 2) develop hidden Markov models (HMMs) and input-output HMMs to identify clusters of patients with similar progression patterns within the sepsis spectrum; 3) provide an analytical framework to support sepsis staging in clinical practice using bilevel optimization. They will 1) predict short- and long-term individual patient outcomes using multivariate statistical models and simulation; 2) develop semi-Markov decision process and partially observable semi-Markov decision process models to identify timing of therapeutic actions and diagnostic tests. Furthermore, the team will 1) predict demand for resources and develop and validate a hybrid mixed integer programming and queueing model to optimize system level allocations; 2) utilize human factors analysis and usability testing to assess the implementation of the DSS.",Mayo Clinic Rochester,,,6/1/2139,"$586,204.00 "

However, after discharge, there are currently few sensor-based decision support systems extending to home, workplace, and community. Postoperative care primarily depends on episodic follow-up visits and rare electrocardiograms. Very little has been done to continuously monitor clinical parameters of postoperative patients, estimate clinical status, and further help optimal management of postoperative recovery. This EArly-concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) award supports fundamental research to develop a collaborative sensing, statistical modeling and decision-making strategy for optimizing postoperative management of heart health.  This research will help clinicians and patients leverage the fast development of sensing and mobile technology to achieve a substantial boost in smart postoperative management.  As a result, this project will provide education on heart-healthy living and raise the awareness of smart health.  In addition, realizing a better postoperative care will achieve a reduction in healthcare costs.  A broader impact in education will be realized through new curriculum modules, training of healthcare professionals, and recruitment of under-represented students.<br/><br/>In current practice, ad hoc strategies are widely used for managing postoperative risks.  This award will make possible a new sensor-based, patient-centered management of heart health that can overcome several limitations of existing practices. In particular, it will empower clinicians and patients to (1) quantitatively measure the quality of life before and after cardiac procedures, (2) optimize postoperative cardiac care and decrease arrhythmia recurrences, and (3) improve lifestyle modifications and positively influence general postoperative outcomes.  If successful, this research will lead to new data imputation algorithms to tackle uncertainty in patient-centered sensing, extract sensor-based biomarkers of cardiac risks, model the evolving dynamics of cardiac conditions, and optimize postoperative management under uncertainty. The success of this project will invoke a new ""sensing-modeling-optimization"" approach to theoretically formulate relationships connecting physiological signals from postoperative patients, useful information from analytical models with smart postoperative health management.

Non-pharmacological interventions provided by caregivers (e.g., distraction, providing rest, calming the environment, speaking softly, gentle touch, favorite music selections, etc.) can reduce the frequency and severity of agitation in PWD. However, agitation can be unpredictable and influenced by the environment, and early signs of agitation often go undetected and can escalate to aggressive agitation that is more difficult to manage. As a result, most methods used to deal with agitation in dementia are reactive rather than proactive and are administered too late in an agitation escalation to be effective. A tool to predict agitation episodes and detect early stages of agitation would empower caregivers to intervene early and ultimately reduce agitation, thus reducing caregiver burden and extending aging-in-place and the associated quality-of-life and cost benefits. This caregiver empowerment based strategy to PWD care could have a significant impact on the ability of PWD to age-in-place. Community outreach efforts will be conducted that engage PWD and their caregivers throughout the project, and the resulting knowledge products can be disseminated to a range of stakeholders across various sociocultural ecosystems, from researchers to family members and respite providers. The project rests on the practice of universal access, demonstrating a design that is beneficial to and accessible by the broadest range of user groups. This project will also establish a framework for a collaborative approach between engineers, clinicians, and the caregiving community to address critical healthcare needs, which will be the basis of new course modules and conference workshops.<br/><br/>This project will overcome the fundamental scientific barriers to realizing such a tool with a three-phase research plan to employ Behavioral and Environmental Sensing and Intervention. First, a system of body-worn and in-home sensors will be developed to provide continuous, non-invasive agitation assessment and environmental context monitoring. Second, this system will be deployed in the homes of community-dwelling PWD to model the relationship between agitation and the environment and to identify features of early-stage agitation, both of which will inform the development of real-time caregiver notification strategies. Third, proof-of-concept for will be demonstrated through a human subject pilot study, with caregivers receiving real-time notifications to alter the environment in advance of probable agitation episodes and to administer PWD interventions in the early stages of agitation. Successful completion of this 3-phase project will motivate a follow-up large-scale proof-of-practice study.The investigative team combines expertise in technology function (computer engineering), accessibility (human centered design), and applicability (medical research and clinical care) to address fundamental challenges of multimodal sensing system-of-systems, modeling cyber-socio-physical system dynamics, and real-time notifications - all within the context of a critical societal need. Diverse sensor streams will be aggregated by fusing assorted data types across multiple time scales, aggregated data will be analyzed using novel agitation assessment and environmental characterization methods, extracted information will be used to develop dynamic system models, and customized automated notifications will empower caregivers to intervene before agitation escalation - all while meeting real-time intervention requirements. These models will be PWD-caregiver dyad specific, requiring dynamic in-situ training, and will present new ontologies for cyber-socio-physical systems that incorporate contexts, technologies, and social dyads to predict and mitigate disruptive neurological events.

One limitation to effective disaster response is easy and rapid access to diverse information about available resources, community resource needs, baseline and current environmental conditions. This project aims to expand access to environmental and drinking water quality disaster response and recovery data in a publicly available format using a widely used collaborative online sharing platform named HydroShare.   Curating a central repository of assembled data has the potential to greatly facilitate coordinated disaster responses of all types, and improve the monitoring of the recovery process. The project team will prototype this system with an assessment of drinking water, environment, and public health concerns unique to Puerto Rico in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria. By working directly with public water utilities, the project team intends to characterize and map the severity of impaired water resources and distribution systems in Puerto Rico, inform communities about how to protect themselves against hazards specific to their water, and to contribute to rebuilding so the nation is better prepared for future hurricanes. Developing cyber and social infrastructure to understand the dynamics of drinking water contamination after natural disasters will improve disaster preparedness and response, and contribute to efforts across the nation and the world to build for a resilient future.<br/><br/>Recovery efforts from natural disasters can be more efficient with data-driven information on current needs and future risks. This project aims to advance open-source software infrastructure to support scientific investigation and data-driven decision making with a prototype system using a water quality assessment developed to investigate post-Hurricane Maria drinking water contamination in Puerto Rico. The widespread disruption of water treatment processes and uncertain drinking water quality within distribution systems in Puerto Rico poses risk to human health. However, there is no existing digital infrastructure to scientifically determine the impacts of the hurricane to inform a response to the crisis. After every natural disaster, including hurricane Maria, elementary questions on how to provide high quality water supplies and support basic human health are difficult to answer.  This project will archive and make accessible data on environmental variables unique to Puerto Rico and Hurricane Maria, damage caused by the storm, and will begin to address time sensitive needs of citizens. By working directly with drinking water utilities to collect samples of biological and inorganic drinking water quality, this project aims to generate understanding and awareness of the degree to which drinking water systems were impacted by Hurricane Maria and the status of drinking water infrastructure and emergency recovery in Puerto Rico after the storm. The goal of this project is to advance understanding of how the severity of a hazard to human health (e.g., no access to safe culinary water) is related to the sophistication, connectivity, and operations of the physical and related digital infrastructure systems. By rapidly collecting data in the early stages of recovery, the team plans to test the design of an integrated cyberinfrastructure system to increase the accessibility of environmental and health data for understanding the impacts from hurricane-related natural disasters. The team will test and stress the CUAHSI HydroShare data publication mechanisms and capabilities to (1) assess the spatial and temporal presence of waterborne pathogens in public water systems impacted by a natural disaster, (2) demonstrate usability of HydroShare as a clearinghouse to centralize selected datasets related to Hurricane Maria, and (3) develop a prototype cyberinfrastructure to assess environmental conditions and public health impacted by natural disasters.

Since introduction of electronic fetal monitoring (EFM) to the labor and delivery rooms about half a century ago, the national rate of Cesarean section deliveries has risen five-fold.  The main need driving Cesarean sections is a concern for oxygen deprivation in the fetsus' brain or hypoxic brain injury. These injuries result in problems such as cerebral palsy. While the number of Cesarean sections has increased,  the rates of various health conditions associated hypoxia remain unchanged. The fundamental problem with EFM is that besides hypoxia, a number of innocuous factors can cause alarming EFM traces, which may lead to unnecessary medical interventions. The project aims to address this problem by research, development and validation of technology for non-invasive transabdominal measurement of fetal arterial blood oxygen saturation.

There is mounting evidence that EHRs are a rich resource for clinical research, but they are notoriously difficult to leverage because of their orientation to healthcare business operations, heterogeneity across commercial systems, and high levels of missing or erroneous entries. Moreover, the interactions among different data sources within an EHR are challenging to model, hampering our ability to leverage traditional analytic frameworks. In recognition of this problem, various efforts have been undertaken to transform EHR data into concise and meaningful concepts, or phenotypes. Yet, to date, these efforts have been ad hoc and labor intensive, resulting in specific phenotypes for specific environments; e.g., type 2 diabetes in the EHR system at Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC). There is an urgent need for scalable phenotyping methods, but several major challenges must be addressed, including: a) patient representation, b) high-throughput phenotype generation from EHRs, c) expert-guided phenotype refinement, and d) phenotype adaptation across institutions. The goal of this project is to address these challenges by developing a general computational framework for transforming EHR data into meaningful phenotypes with only modest levels of expert guidance.

The federal government has committed $27 billion dollars over the coming decade, to fund the implementation of EHRs through an incentive-based program for organizations that demonstrate ""meaningful use"" of certified EHR technology. Though the potential for EHRs to improve the quality of health care is generally understood, researchers suggest that concerns about the confidentiality and privacy of EHRs present significant barriers to their effective use. As health IT becomes more widespread, health information breaches are increasing, as is public attention to such breaches, as are general concerns about the privacy and security of health information.

The goal of this project is to develop and evaluate technology for automatic in-vehicle monitoring of early symptoms of medical conditions and disrupted medications of patients, and to provide preventive care. Specifically, in this project we will focus on Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in teenagers and young adults, a prevalent chronic medical condition which when uncontrolled has the potential for known negative health and quality of life consequences. The approach of using driving behavior to monitor ADHD symptoms could be applied to many other medical conditions (such as diabetes, failing eyesight, intoxication, fatigue or heart attacks) thereby transforming medical management into real-time sensing and management. Identification of all these conditions from driving behavior and alerting the proper agent could transform how we think about health monitoring and result in saved lives and reduced injuries.<br/><br/>The main goal of this project is to leverage the large amounts of health data that can be collected while driving via machine learning, in order to detect subtle changes in behavior due to out-of-control ADHD symptoms that can, for example, indicate the onset of episodes of inattention before they happen.

Current diagnosis of SDB is performed in hospital sleep laboratories by monitoring patients with a host of cardiorespiratory sensors attached at various positions on the patient?s body. This obtrusive form of monitoring is inconvenient to patients and require tremendous amount of attention from technicians to ensure study quality. Children, especially, tolerate the study very poorly; often removing sensors, having trouble sleeping, and necessitating repeat investigations. This project aims to develop a new method to remotely and continuously monitor breathing volume and breathing patterns of human subjects during sleep studies using optical signals assisted by radio frequency signals. We introduce RadiOptiMeter, a hybrid radio-optical breath volume monitoring approach that couple the unique characteristics of radio frequency (RF) signals with image stream captured by a depth-CO2-thermal camera to accurately estimate breathing volume of sleeping patients from afar. This study is the first step in the development of non-invasive respiratory monitoring.

We propose techniques to address challenges brought about by the body movement during sleep, environmental wireless signal noises, and the diversity of patient populations. An expected outcome is a robust and accurate breathing volume monitoring system for SDB studies. The cooperation between each of the proposed devices allows us to exploit the synergistic effects of the devices to cover the limitations imposed by each device type and provides system redundancies. These redundancies ensure reliability for long-term monitoring tasks, which are critical for clinical applications. Our proposed research will make the following key contributions to enable new non-contact vital signal monitoring system: (1) Analytical models, experimental tools, and evaluation results of a breathing volume estimation method using a vision-based system (VVE) which include 4D volumetric model and skeletal structure analysis from depth- CO2-thermal (DCT) camera outputs. (2) Analytical models, experimental hardware and software components, and evaluation results of a RF-based breathing volume estimation (RVE) system, that uses neural-network-based machine learning for chest displacement- to-volume matching. (3) A hybrid radio-optical breathing volume estimation system (RadiOptiMeter) that synergistically combines the VVE and RVE to perform continuous and fine-grain monitoring.

This approach addresses the problem of physiological monitoring today that requires skin contacts such as electrodes for ECG, and hence cannot scale to widespread monitoring of patients and healthy adults for years. The key challenge is to develop high-resolution sensing on low-power mobile platforms that can separate out the weak motion signals of heart and lung, from the gross motion of the body and the sensor. The project is developing theory and design for a compressive ultrawideband (UWB) RF sensor that achieves two orders of magnitude reduction in the required sampling rate to make it feasible to realize in a low-power mobile form factor. EasySense employs dynamic compressive sensing algorithms to improve the quality of sensing through temporal integration of information and employs interference subspace cancelation methods to cancel out motion artifacts using data obtained from accelerometers and gyroscopes. The project is implementing all the needed hardware, firmware, embedded software on the sensor node for sampling, processing, and wireless communication, and mobile phone software for data collection, storage, and visualization.

One limitation to effective disaster response is easy and rapid access to diverse information about available resources, community resource needs, baseline and current environmental conditions. This project aims to expand access to environmental and drinking water quality disaster response and recovery data in a publicly available format using a widely used collaborative online sharing platform named HydroShare.   Curating a central repository of assembled data has the potential to greatly facilitate coordinated disaster responses of all types, and improve the monitoring of the recovery process. The project team will prototype this system with an assessment of drinking water, environment, and public health concerns unique to Puerto Rico in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria. By working directly with public water utilities, the project team intends to characterize and map the severity of impaired water resources and distribution systems in Puerto Rico, inform communities about how to protect themselves against hazards specific to their water, and to contribute to rebuilding so the nation is better prepared for future hurricanes. Developing cyber and social infrastructure to understand the dynamics of drinking water contamination after natural disasters will improve disaster preparedness and response, and contribute to efforts across the nation and the world to build for a resilient future.<br/><br/>Recovery efforts from natural disasters can be more efficient with data-driven information on current needs and future risks. This project aims to advance open-source software infrastructure to support scientific investigation and data-driven decision making with a prototype system using a water quality assessment developed to investigate post-Hurricane Maria drinking water contamination in Puerto Rico. The widespread disruption of water treatment processes and uncertain drinking water quality within distribution systems in Puerto Rico poses risk to human health. However, there is no existing digital infrastructure to scientifically determine the impacts of the hurricane to inform a response to the crisis. After every natural disaster, including hurricane Maria, elementary questions on how to provide high quality water supplies and support basic human health are difficult to answer.  This project will archive and make accessible data on environmental variables unique to Puerto Rico and Hurricane Maria, damage caused by the storm, and will begin to address time sensitive needs of citizens. By working directly with drinking water utilities to collect samples of biological and inorganic drinking water quality, this project aims to generate understanding and awareness of the degree to which drinking water systems were impacted by Hurricane Maria and the status of drinking water infrastructure and emergency recovery in Puerto Rico after the storm. The goal of this project is to advance understanding of how the severity of a hazard to human health (e.g., no access to safe culinary water) is related to the sophistication, connectivity, and operations of the physical and related digital infrastructure systems. By rapidly collecting data in the early stages of recovery, the team plans to test the design of an integrated cyberinfrastructure system to increase the accessibility of environmental and health data for understanding the impacts from hurricane-related natural disasters.

Family caregivers often report increased anxiety and depression, and many forego their own health needs as the demands of being a family caregiver are sustained over many years. It is also known that poor interactions between patient and caregiver increase the difficulty of providing care. Monitoring reactivity between patient and caregiver could signal when problematic interactions might occur. Just-in-time or even predictive recommendations in those moments could improve these interactions and reduce strain on caregivers. This project develops a monitoring, modeling, and interactive recommendation solution (for caregivers) for in-home dementia patient care that focuses on caregiver-patient relationships. This includes monitoring for mood and stress and analyzing the significance of monitoring those attributes to dementia patient care and subsequent behavior dynamics between patient and caregiver. In addition, novel and adaptive behavioral suggestions at the right moments aim at helping improve familial interactions related to caregiving, which over time should ameliorate the stressful effects of the patient's illness and decrease strain on caregivers. This work could also benefit nursing homes and assisted living facilities by improving care for their residents, and could be useful for other caregiving situations, including the care of children with emotional/behavioral challenges who are cared for at home by their families.

The TwitterHealth project is developing techniques to extract reliable public health information from social media.  In essence, the online population becauses a vast organic sensor network.  Statistical natural language processing techniques are employed to classify tweets (or other social media postings) as self-reports of disease or particular behaviors of interest.  GPS information included in postings made from cell phones allow a variety of behavioral information to be inferred about each user, such as the venues visited and the other individuals from the data set who are encountered.<br/><br/>Major technical challenges for using social media in this manner are the highly noisy nature of the information channel, scaling to a large number of different health conditions, and the need to discover causal influences as well as correlations between behavioral and environmental factors and health.  The challenge of noise is approached by learning dynamic relational models of health states, which generalize classical epidemiological models but support individual as well as aggregate predictions.  The scaling challenge is dealt with by knowledge transfer techniques, which reduce data and computational requirements by transfering information between models for different health conditions.  Specific knowledge transfer techniques are cascaded training of a target classifier starting with a given classifier for a related but different disease, and the use of ensembles of general and specific classifiers.  The challenge of inferring casuality is addressed by temporal-lag methods, which identify changes in behaviorial or environmental conditions that consistently precede changes in health.  For example, the inference that a venue is a cause (vector) of disease spread is accomplished by tracing backward in time the GPS trails of users who post social media reports of illness.  TwitterHealth employs two approaches for validating its results: first, comparing the aggregate predictions of the model against CDC statistics; second, comparing individuals' behavior in reporting or not reporting disease symptoms in status updates against the behavior predicted by the models.  The project also includes planning for clinic based evaluations, in which subjects identified by their social media postings would provide swabs that would be tested for disease agents.<br/><br/>The TwitterHealth approach to collecting and analyzing health information has the potential to improve public health, by making detailed data about health, behavior, social structure, and geographic influences available in real time and at almost no cost.  While it will not completely replace traditional methods of gathering health information, it provides an important complementary information channel, which emphases speed, reach, and scale.  The project includes outreach expert medical professionals in order to plan future clinical validation.  The outreach interaction provides a forum for exchange of computer science and medical expertise between researchers and students in the two fields.

The proposed techniques eliminate the violation of privacy through re-identification, and facilitate the secondary usage, sharing, publishing and exchange of healthcare data without the risk of breaching protected health information (PHI). This new privacy-preserving framework injects the ICD-9-CM-aware constraint-based privacy-preserving techniques into EHRs to eliminate the threat of identifying an individual in the secondary use of research data. The proposed technique and development can be readily adapted to other types of healthcare databases in order to ensure privacy and prevent re-identification of published data. The project produces groundbreaking algorithms and tools for identifying privacy leakages and protecting personal privacy information in EHRs to improve healthcare data publishing. New privacy-preserving techniques developed in this project lead towards a new type of healthcare science for EHRs. The project also delivers fundamental advancements to engineering by showing how to integrate biomedical domain knowledge with a computationally advanced quantitative framework for preserving the privacy of published EHRs. HIPAA has established protocols and industry standards to protect the confidentiality of PHI. However, our results demonstrate that, even with regard to health data that meets HIPAA requirements, the risk of re-identification is not completely eliminated. By identifying the security vulnerabilities inherent in the HIPAA standards, our research develops a more rigorous security standard that greatly improves privacy protections by applying state-of-the-art algorithms.<br/> <br/>The developed data privacy-preserving framework has significant implications for the future of US healthcare data publishing and related applications. Specifically, the transition from paper records to EHRs has accelerated significantly since the passage of the HITECH Act of 2009. The Act provides monetary incentives for the ""meaningful use"" of EHRs. As a result, the quality and quantity of healthcare databases has risen sharply, which has renewed the public's fear of a breach of privacy of their medical information. This research work is innovative and crucial not only for facilitating EHR data publishing, but also for enhancing the development and promotion of EHRs. At the educational front, this project facilitates the development of novel educational tools to construct entirely new courses and laboratory classes for healthcare, data privacy, data mining, and a wide range of applications. As a result, it enhances the current instructional methods for teaching data privacy and data mining, and has compelling biomedical and healthcare applications that can facilitate learning of computational algorithms.

Models of disease, or phenotypes, are derived from a large collection of patient characteristics, as recorded in the EHR. To assess their value and robustness in a clinical application, the phenotypes are incorporated into a longitudinal patient record summarization system for clinicians at the point of patient care.<br/><br/>The research for this project contributes to two inter-related outcomes: (i) a probabilistic graphical model of a patient record, specifically a Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model of the patient phenotypes.  Models that can handle the heterogeneous data types in the EHR, along with their challenges, such as sparseness and artificial redundancy are investigated. For the models to be useful in the clinical world, they must be interpretable by humans, easily adaptable for EHR-driven applications, and clinically relevant. This is achieved by specifying prior clinical knowledge into the models and learning from clinicians' feedback automatically; and (ii) a patient record summarizer for clinicians at the point of patient care. The summarizer leverages the probabilistic patient model and learns new models of salience through the clinicians' interactions with the deployed summarizer, in essence learning relevance of different patient phenotypes. For the evaluation of the phenome model and the summarizer, particular care is given to assessing their value in a real-world clinical setting, at the point of care.<br/><br/>The research builds on and is translated into deliverables that are robust and are inter-operable with the EHR of a large hospital in New York City. If successful, the availability of interpretable and actionable patient models can impact drastically both EHR-driven research activities and patient care, through better tools for clinicians.

The Emergency Care Research Institute  named alarm hazards as the number one of the 'Top 10 Health Technology Hazards' for 2012, 2013 and 2015. Healthcare providers are usually overwhelmed with 350 alarm conditions per patient per day, of which 80-99% are meaningless or false. These false alarms can be due to several factors such as patient movement, malfunction of individual sensors and imperfections in the patient-equipment contact, resulting in alarm fatigue among healthcare providers and the possibility of missing a true life-threatening event lost in a cacophony of multiple alarms. These false alarms can also cause patient anxiety, inferior sleep structure and depressed immune systems. Thereby, alarm safety has been determined as a national patient safety goal by The Joint Commission, which accredits and certifies nearly 21,000 health care organizations and programs in the United States. <br/><br/>This project will develop a multifaceted framework to reduce the false alarm rate in Intensive Care Units (ICUs) by integrating principles from information theory, game theory, graph theory and signal processing.  The alarms in ICUs are mostly created based on the measurements made by individual machine/monitors, while the majority of the alarms produced by these individual machines are considered false. The majority of current methods to suppress the false alarm rate attempt to design new monitors or create more accurate sensors. These methods are often tailored to specific devices or datasets and the significant intrinsic correlations among the extracted features from different sensors are overlooked in these methods. A real-time and accurate yet general method will be developed to reduce the number of false alarms while avoiding the suppression of true alarms through integrating information from a variety of devices and considering the non-linear correlations and mutual information among the features collected from these devices using a new game theoretic approach. The performance of this proposed method will be evaluated using PhysionNet's publicly available MIMIC II dataset considering the three vital signals of ECG, PLETH, and APB. The proposed false alarm detection method can potentially save many patients' lives and significantly reduce medical costs. This work can advance the research program and practice of teaching at the newly established Northern Arizona University School of Informatics, Computing and Cyber System (SICCS) by developing a new course in game theoretical optimizations, integration of this research in several undergraduate-level course modules and training of graduate students.","Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey-RBHS-Robert Wood",,,8/31/2019,"$300,000.00 "

There is mounting evidence that EHRs are a rich resource for clinical research, but they are notoriously difficult to leverage because of their orientation to healthcare business operations, heterogeneity across commercial systems, and high levels of missing or erroneous entries. Moreover, the interactions among different data sources within an EHR are challenging to model, hampering our ability to leverage traditional analytic frameworks. In recognition of this problem, various efforts have been undertaken to transform EHR data into concise and meaningful concepts, or phenotypes. Yet, to date, these efforts have been ad hoc and labor intensive, resulting in specific phenotypes for specific environments; e.g., type 2 diabetes in the EHR system at Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC). There is an urgent need for scalable phenotyping methods, but several major challenges must be addressed, including: a) patient representation, b) high-throughput phenotype generation from EHRs, c) expert-guided phenotype refinement, and d) phenotype adaptation across institutions. The goal of this project is to address these challenges by developing a general computational framework for transforming EHR data into meaningful phenotypes with only modest levels of expert guidance.  The PIs will develop novel courses on Healthcare Analytics as a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) that covers cross-disciplinary topics at the confluence of computer science and medical informatics, while embellishing existing graduate courses on biomedical informatics. The PIs plan to deliver tutorials and organize workshops at relevant computer science and medical informatics conferences with the goal of sharing research results and developing a community. The PIs will develop outreach modules that focus on freshmen and under-represented students, as well as educational sessions for clinical researchers who are currently performing phenotyping in academic medical centers.  Thus, the project has a significant component the integrates research and education as well as providing for new scientific insights.<br/><br/>In support of this goal, the team plans to represent and analyze EHR data as inter-connected high-order relations i.e. tensors (e.g. tuples of patient-medication-diagnosis, patient-lab, and patient-symptoms). The proposed analytic framework generalizes several existing data mining methodologies, including dimensionality reduction, topic modeling and co-clustering, which all arise as limited special cases of analyzing second order tensors. It will also enable flexible refinement of candidates to adapt phenotypes from one healthcare institution to another, and will incorporate feedback from domain experts. The accompanying suite of algorithms and methods will enable the automation of high-throughput phenotype generation, refinement, adaptation and applications, in a broad range of health informatics settings and across multiple institutions. This project will integrate biomedical informaticists, computer scientists, and clinical experts. The significance of the resulting phenotypes in diverse clinical applications, including: a) cohort construction, where case and control patients are identified with respect to specific phenotype combinations; b) genome wide association studies (GWAS), where target phenotypes of patients are tested against DNA sequence variation for significant statistical associations; and c) clinical predictive modeling, where a model is developed to predict target phenotypes or diseases will be demonstrated. The framework will be developed with public accessible data from MIMIC-II and CMS and validate in real clinical environments at Northwestern Memorial Hospital and VUMC through several high-impact disease targets (including hypertension, type 2 diabetes, hypothyroidism, atrial fibrillation, rheumatoid arthritis, and multiple sclerosis). Additionally, the methodologies developed through this project will be integrated into existing software platforms that support the representation of EHR-derived phenotypes, but lack a data-driven component for the generation and refinement of candidates.

However, lack of access to expert medical diagnosis and care, especially in rural areas, remains a growing healthcare challenge. In addition, clinical expertise in ROP is lacking, and medical professionals are struggling to meet the increasing need for ROP care. As point-of-care technologies for diagnosis and intervention are rapidly expanding, the potential ability to assess ROP severity from any location with an internet connection and a camera, even without immediate ophthalmologic consultation available, could significantly improve delivery of ROP care by identifying infants who are in most urgent need for referral and treatment.

Forty million Americans undergo surgery yearly. Approximately five percent die within a year of their operation, and roughly ten percent suffer major in-hospital morbidity (e.g., stroke, heart attack, pneumonia, renal failure, wound infection). Early recognition of risk and appropriate management could often prevent or modify these adverse outcomes. We believe that this represents an exciting scientific opportunity. Modern intraoperative monitoring yields a wealth of data from thousands of operating rooms across the US.  Integration and real-time analysis of these data streams has the potential to revolutionize perioperative care. We propose to develop, validate and assess machine-learning, forecasting algorithms that predict adverse outcomes for individual patients. The forecasting algorithms will be based on data derived from various sources, including the patient's electronic medical record, the array of physiological monitors in the operating room, and evidence-based scientific literature. These algorithms will facilitate patient-specific clinical decision support, utilizing an innovative approach of an anesthesiology control tower. The anesthesiology control tower for the operating room will be conceptually similar to an air traffic control tower for a busy airport.

Modifiable risk factors for adverse events could be detected early during surgery, allowing targeted interventions and preventive measures. The ACTFAST study will provide important information on the potential utility of incorporating forecasting algorithms into routine surgical care, including in under-resourced healthcare settings.

The objective for this investigation is to exploit our experience in running innovative machine learning algorithms, including filtering and outcome-related models, in order to build forecasting algorithms tailored to individual surgical patients. Our central hypothesis is that with sufficient knowledge of patient characteristics coupled with repeated, high-fidelity time series data from the intraoperative electronic medical record, advanced models can be constructed for individual patients that will forecast risk for adverse postoperative outcomes. First, using a training dataset, we will apply data mining and machine-learning methods that we have previously validated to extract useful information from electronic health records and real-time physiological variables. We will develop algorithms using hybrid-learning techniques to combine the strength of non-parametric (generative) models, such as histogram and kernel density estimation, and parametric (discriminative) models, such as support vector machines, logistic regressions, and kernel machines to improve predictions of adverse perioperative outcomes. The goal is to deliver superior prediction quality, with good interpretability and high computational efficiency, that supports fast processing of big data. Second, using a testing dataset, we will validate the predictive accuracy of the developed algorithms, by determining the reliability in forecasting adverse outcomes. The developed algorithms will be tested for accuracy of their predictive performance. These evaluation methods include hold-out sampling, cross-validation, and bootstrap sampling. After being trained and tested, the performance of the developed algorithms will be additionally validated prospectively (out-of-sample performance), using standard measures of accuracy, precision and robustness.

One in ten healthcare dollars in the U.S. is spent on costs directly attributable to diabetes. Persons with Type-1 diabetes, especially children and the elderly, can experience sudden drops in blood sugar, that is, they can become hypoglycemic. This can be very dangerous if it remains unrecognized. The metabolic processes that lead to hypoglycemia generate odorants in human breath and perspiration. The specific odorants are not known by the medical community, but trained diabetes alert dogs can recognize the onset of hypoglycemia from odorants in a patient's breath. This award supports the basic research to identify the odorants of hypoglycemia in human breath and the development of a noninvasive hand-held smart sensor able to detect the odorants and communicate health information to patients, caregivers, and family members. Development of the smart device will improve health-monitoring options for persons with Type-1 diabetes, ultimately leading to decreased healthcare costs and improved lifestyles for the patients and their caregivers. This research will provide interdisciplinary research experiences to graduate and undergraduate students. In addition, this project will support participation of underrepresented groups and educational outreach programs for K-12 students and teachers across Indiana and the U.S.<br/><br/>The metabolic processes that lead to hypoglycemia cause the production of specific volatile organic compounds in human breath. This fact is not currently used by the medical community to monitor diabetes or track the onset of hypoglycemia. However, trained diabetes alert dogs are able to identify these compounds and recognize the onset of hypoglycemia. Following this, the objective of this proposal is to develop a novel smart device able to detect the volatile organic compound profile in human breath that correlates with hypoglycemia. This will be accomplished in three steps. First, the identification of the hypoglycemic-signature breath profile, which will be validated by testing with diabetes alert dogs. Second, the development of a nanosensor array capable of detecting the identified compounds. Third, the incorporation of the nanosensor array into a portable smart device. The monitoring of volatile organic compounds in breath challenges the existing way of thinking that glucose is the only useful metabolic marker of hypoglycemia. This work will also aid researchers in understanding metabolic pathways associated with hypoglycemia.

Early diagnosis is critically important for successful treatment, and can prevent most cases of blindness. However, lack of access to expert medical diagnosis and care, especially in rural areas, remains a growing healthcare challenge. In addition, clinical expertise in ROP is lacking, and medical professionals are struggling to meet the increasing need for ROP care. As point-of-care technologies for diagnosis and intervention are rapidly expanding, the potential ability to assess ROP severity from any location with an internet connection and a camera, even without immediate ophthalmologic consultation available, could significantly improve delivery of ROP care by identifying infants who are in most urgent need for referral and treatment. This would dramatically reduce the incidence of blindness without a proportionate increase in the need for human resources, which take many years to develop. <br/><br/>This project develops a prototype assistive integrative support tool for ROP, featuring a modular design comprising: (a) image analysis, (b) information fusion of clinical, imaging, and diagnostic data, and (c) generative probabilistic and regression models with associated computationally efficient machine learning algorithms.

These labels consist of discrete diagnostic labels, as well as comparison outcomes of relative severity between pairs of images. Random process models for vessel tortuosity and diameter distributions over the retina, as well as patch-based vessel-free image analysis through the use of convolutional neural networks on the entire image, enhance and augment feature extraction. Moreover, incorporating severity comparison outcomes through novel hard and soft constraint methods force inferred severity to agree with ordinal information provided by experts and address inherent uncertainty in expert ground-truth labels.

The heterogeneity of TBI and the ability to reliably stratify critically-ill patients who will likely have better outcomes for a certain intervention are amongst the major challenges in clinical research. To address these challenges, this project develops a comprehensive set of machine learning methods that can be broadly applied to a variety of problems. Data sources include both in-patient bedside data as well as remotely monitored telemedicine data, thus connecting data at multiple levels for specific patient populations.

Women's health represents one of the most pressing health-policy issues impacting our nation. In no medical specialty are the deficiencies of medical evidence more pronounced than in women's health, especially in obstetrics. Over the course of the human life span, birth is one of the most dangerous health episodes for both mother and baby. Worldwide, between 2.6 and 4 million pregnancies result in stillbirth annually. Unlike other leading causes of mortality, birth-related deaths are largely preventable. Today, however, most adverse pregnancy outcomes are not predictable, and cannot be prevented. In this project, the research team will passively monitor a cohort of one thousand pregnant women from their first prenatal visit to six weeks post-partum. To accomplish this, participants will download the HealthyPregnancy smartphone app developed in this project to collect in situ social and behavioral data. The application passively captures participant's interactions with people and places via sensors and software throughout pregnancy. Analysis of this large collection of digital data, in combination with traditional medical monitoring data collected via participant's medical records will result in a digital phenotype of pregnancy. The digital phenotype allows for a more complete understanding of pregnancy at the macro scale and for more detailed understanding of outcomes as a continuum rather than isolated discrete events. <br/><br/>It is widely understood that activity, social support, sleep, and cognitive function are important markers of health, particularly during pregnancy. Maternal obesity is associated with a number of complications in pregnancy including gestational diabetes, pre-eclampsia, macrosomia, caesarean delivery and stillbirth. Lack of social support and social interaction is also an important risk factor and has been shown to have adverse effects on pregnancy outcomes. Sleep disturbances are associated with poor health outcomes, particularly cardiovascular disease and inflammatory responses. Additionally, short sleep duration is associated with an increased incidence in diabetes and obesity and has been associated with an increase in mortality. Research suggests that women who experience pre-eclampsia more frequently report daily cognitive failures and increased emotional dysfunction years later. With the ubiquitous use of smartphones, it is now possible to collect lived experiences or data reflecting markers of pregnancy in the wild. Collecting accelerometer and GPS over time provide an indication of physical mobility and gross motor activity. Call and text message logs detail communication events and contribute to a view of social interaction and social contacts. Additionally, power state, screen time and touch events can be used to understand potential sleep disruption. Of greater significance is the analysis of this data in aggregate over the course of pregnancy. This longitudinal view and analysis of pregnancy in the wild using machine learning and mathematical models provides both an individual's digital phenotype of pregnancy and an aggregate digital phenotype of pregnancy. By gathering and analyzing these two products, they can be used to better understand outcomes and the continuum of events leading up to pregnancy outcomes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",Florida Atlantic University,,,8/31/2018,"$166,935.00 "

These guidelines are viewed as the key to improving patient care and reducing costs, but current guidelines tend to be specific to individual diseases, and rarely consider all of the relevant details of a patient's condition, such as age, gender, and ethnic background, as well as other diseases from which patients suffer. By addressing the challenge of personalized evidence based medicine, the research in this project will positively impact patients suffering from multiple chronic conditions, which is becoming the norm in the aging US population.  To that end, this project will develop new clinical modeling techniques that can use the data available in electronic health records (EHRs) to improve the personalization of these guidelines. More specifically, the ultimate goal of this project is to generate more personalized guidelines that can be implemented in clinical decision support systems and used by physicians and others for the comprehensive treatment of patients with multiple chronic conditions.<br/><br/>To address the challenge of personalized care guidelines to handle multiple chronic conditions, this project develops a modeling framework, Group-Specific Learning (GSL), with the ability to enhance clinical modeling by making models increasingly personalized without rendering them excessively specific. In particular, the GSL modeling paradigm is applied to enhance four modeling techniques commonly used in health sciences research: survival analysis, causal analysis via propensity scoring, competing risk models and multi-state models. This work focuses on type-II diabetes mellitus (T2DM), its precursor, pre-diabetes, its comorbidities (hypertension, obesity, hyperlipidemia), and its consequences (chronic kidney disease, renal failure and the various cardiac and vascular complications).

To address this limitation, this project develops a suite of analytics techniques that can take the substantial heterogeneity that exists in the diabetic population into account in order to measure the effect of existing evidence-based guideline elements (interventions) in terms of risk of progression to diabetic complications.

Regular use of HAs has been shown to improve communication and avoid the negative effects of hearing loss that include an increased risk of social isolation, depression, and inability to work, travel, or be physically active. Past research has shown that many people do not wear their HAs regularly, as they are unsatisfied with the performance in the real world. A fundamental limitation of existing methods for tuning HA is that they are not tailored to individual needs, which often leads to unsatisfactory performance. As part of this project, a team of computer scientists, engineers, and audiologists will develop new methods for tuning HAs that are based on the individual needs of a patient.<br/><br/>The project is based on the approach that better HA configurations may be identified based on feedback from the patient that is collected in the moment and in situ. The project includes development of two systems for optimizing the configuration of HAs. The first system will improve the efficacy of the traditional tuning process by improving how feedback is obtained from patients, combined with auditory context information, and translated into HA configuration adjustments. The second system will automatically adapt the configuration of a HA based on patient feedback and auditory context information without requiring an audiologist to perform adjustments. The intellectual merit of this proposal includes the advances in machine learning necessary to model the performance of complex systems that have numerous parameters such as HAs and tuning their parameters based on feedback obtained from patients. Additionally, the project will advance the state-of-the-art in embedded systems by developing techniques to run HA optimization algorithms as part of a multi-tier system composed of HAs, mobile phones, and cloud services. It is anticipated that the proposed research will empower patients to become more involved in their hearing care, improve HA satisfaction, and enrich their social interactions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",University of Texas at Dallas,,,2/1/2133,"$145,596.00 "

On June 30, 2015, the Institute of Medicine released a report on strategies for increasing survival rates after cardiac arrest.  The report calls for effective treatment, demanding an immediate response from bystanders to recognize cardiac arrest, call 911, and initiate cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Given that the time interval for Emergency Medical Service (EMS) arrival is often 7 to 8 minutes or longer, based on American Heart Association (AHA) research, survival falls 7% to 10% for each minute without CPR.  Chest compressions during CPR can generate a small but critical amount of blood flow to vital organs such as the brain and heart until circulation is restored by EMS personnel. While defining high-quality CPR, the AHA puts priority on specific characteristics including the rate of compressions, depth, and full release after each compression (recoil).  To follow AHA's guidelines and improve CPR technique, researchers at the University of North Texas propose an effective smartphone application that can be used to provide real-time evaluation and feedback during CPR. The developed science and technology from this EAGER project can be used to evaluate and certify community workers, provide resuscitation quality improvement (RQI), and offer assistance to bystanders during a cardiac arrest. <br/><br/>Typical CPR training for health care workers entails watching videos and listening to lectures in a classroom setting every two years. Looking to the future, the EAGER campaign has the potential to transform the way CPR training and administration is handled. Based on the data yielded from the EAGER proposal, healthcare workers would only need to spend 5-10 minutes each month to effectively improve CPR administration and substantially increase the survival rate of patients. In order to accomplish this, we propose to: i) change the CPR training period to 5-10 minutes each month instead of one day every two years, ii) effectively assist bystanders who have no prior training in CPR administration, and iii) create a special glove that will house the mobile phone, start the CPR application automatically, and communicate with 9-1-1 operators and physicians.  Hence, the success of EAGER can transform the way we administer and offer CPR training. With favorable outcomes of the proposed research, variability of effective-CPR would dramatically be reduced, leading to higher survival rates. This EAGER project advances interdisciplinary knowledge (mechanics, fluid control, signal processing, and artificial intelligence) in the hopes that cardiac arrest survival no longer depends on environmental factors (e.g., inside or outside of hospital).",University of Texas at Tyler,,,8/31/2018,"$144,754.00 "

About 700,000 people die annually in US hospitals and 16% of them were diagnosed with sepsis (including a high prevalence of severe sepsis with major  complication). In addition to being deadly, sepsis is the most expensive condition associated with in-hospital stay, resulting in a 75% longer stay than any other condition.  The total burden of sepsis to the US healthcare system is estimated to be $20.3 billion, most of which is paid by Medicare and Medicaid. In fact, in June 2015 the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) reported that sepsis accounted for over $7 billion in Medicare payments (second only to major joint replacement), a close to 10% increase from the previous year.  This pervasive drain on health care resources is due, in part, to difficulties in diagnosis and delayed treatment. For example, every one hour delay in treatment of severe sepsis/shock with antibiotics decreases a patient's survival probability by 10%. Many of these deaths could have been averted or postponed if a better system of care was in place. The goal of this research is to overcome these barriers by integrating electronic health records (EHR) and clinical expertise to provide an evidence-based framework to diagnose and accurately risk-stratify patients within the sepsis spectrum, and develop and validate intervention policies that inform sepsis treatment decisions.  The  project to bring together health care providers, researchers, educators, and students to add value to patient care by integrating machine learning, decision analytical models, human factors analysis, as well as system and process modeling to advance scientific knowledge, predict sepsis, and prevent sepsis-related health deterioration. In addition to the societal impact that clinical translation of these findings may bring, the project will provide engineering and computer science students and health services researchers with cross-disciplinary educational experience.<br/><br/>The proposed research will apply engineering and computer science methodologies to analyze patient level EHR across two large scale health care facilities, Mayo Clinic Rochester and Christiana Care Health System and to inform clinical decision making for sepsis.

The team will 1) identify important factors that uncover patient profiles based on Bayesian exponential family principal components analysis; 2) develop hidden Markov models (HMMs) and input-output HMMs to identify clusters of patients with similar progression patterns within the sepsis spectrum; 3) provide an analytical framework to support sepsis staging in clinical practice using bilevel optimization. They will 1) predict short- and long-term individual patient outcomes using multivariate statistical models and simulation; 2) develop semi-Markov decision process and partially observable semi-Markov decision process models to identify timing of therapeutic actions and diagnostic tests.

There is mounting evidence that EHRs are a rich resource for clinical research, but they are notoriously difficult to leverage because of their orientation to healthcare business operations, heterogeneity across commercial systems, and high levels of missing or erroneous entries. Moreover, the interactions among different data sources within an EHR are challenging to model, hampering our ability to leverage traditional analytic frameworks. In recognition of this problem, various efforts have been undertaken to transform EHR data into concise and meaningful concepts, or phenotypes. Yet, to date, these efforts have been ad hoc and labor intensive, resulting in specific phenotypes for specific environments; e.g., type 2 diabetes in the EHR system at Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC). There is an urgent need for scalable phenotyping methods, but several major challenges must be addressed, including: a) patient representation, b) high-throughput phenotype generation from EHRs, c) expert-guided phenotype refinement, and d) phenotype adaptation across institutions. The goal of this project is to address these challenges by developing a general computational framework for transforming EHR data into meaningful phenotypes with only modest levels of expert guidance.  The PIs will develop novel courses on Healthcare Analytics as a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) that covers cross-disciplinary topics at the confluence of computer science and medical informatics, while embellishing existing graduate courses on biomedical informatics. The PIs plan to deliver tutorials and organize workshops at relevant computer science and medical informatics conferences with the goal of sharing research results and developing a community. The PIs will develop outreach modules that focus on freshmen and under-represented students, as well as educational sessions for clinical researchers who are currently performing phenotyping in academic medical centers.  Thus, the project has a significant component the integrates research and education as well as providing for new scientific insights.<br/><br/>In support of this goal, the team plans to represent and analyze EHR data as inter-connected high-order relations i.e. tensors (e.g. tuples of patient-medication-diagnosis, patient-lab, and patient-symptoms). The proposed analytic framework generalizes several existing data mining methodologies, including dimensionality reduction, topic modeling and co-clustering, which all arise as limited special cases of analyzing second order tensors. It will also enable flexible refinement of candidates to adapt phenotypes from one healthcare institution to another, and will incorporate feedback from domain experts. The accompanying suite of algorithms and methods will enable the automation of high-throughput phenotype generation, refinement, adaptation and applications, in a broad range of health informatics settings and across multiple institutions. This project will integrate biomedical informaticists, computer scientists, and clinical experts. The significance of the resulting phenotypes in diverse clinical applications, including: a) cohort construction, where case and control patients are identified with respect to specific phenotype combinations; b) genome wide association studies (GWAS), where target phenotypes of patients are tested against DNA sequence variation for significant statistical associations; and c) clinical predictive modeling, where a model is developed to predict target phenotypes or diseases will be demonstrated. The framework will be developed with public accessible data from MIMIC-II and CMS and validate in real clinical environments at Northwestern Memorial Hospital and VUMC through several high-impact disease targets (including hypertension, type 2 diabetes, hypothyroidism, atrial fibrillation, rheumatoid arthritis, and multiple sclerosis). Additionally, the methodologies developed through this project will be integrated into existing software platforms that support the representation of EHR-derived phenotypes, but lack a data-driven component for the generation and refinement of candidates.

They often induce catastrophic consequences in an array of inaccessible environments with complex curved geometries, ultimately leading to persistent infections, implant failure, and systemic contamination. There is demand for viable methods to detect, prevent, and remove biofilms in locales including urinary catheters, prosthetic implants, and water systems, where currently effective methods do not exist to detect and eradicate biofilms. Advances in flexible device technology yield opportunities for feedback-driven biofilm management systems for operation in these vulnerable areas. The objective is to develop a paradigm enabling dynamic flexible sensor microsystems for detecting, monitoring, and inhibiting biofilms on multidimensional surfaces, in particular the cylindrical environment of a urinary catheter. The surface bacterial species, fluid conditions, and geometry are the basis for this approach, creating a guide for identifying methods of biofilm detection and prevention on demand. Successful monitoring and removal of biofilm will have a dramatic impact, improving quality of life for people of all demographics. These systems have the potential to reduce the spread of antibiotic-resistant and healthcare-acquired infections, and are particularly attractive for addressing these challenges in resource-poor regions. Moreover, the potential for low-cost manufacturing of these devices will enable their inclusion by high school teachers into laboratory-based STEM curricula.<br/><br/>To systematically develop this methodology, the objective of this proposal is divided into three tasks: 1) Optimization of microsystems for sensing and inhibiting biofilms in complex, 3D environments: Thin film electrodes will be selected as a simple and sensitive electrochemical impedance sensor, tested in a microfluidic system as a sensor and biofilm inhibitor via the bioelectric effect. Furthermore, the device will be optimized for biofilm detection via a computational model. The model will examine changes in the electric field of the sensor for the relevant geometry. 2) Manufacturing of integrated flexible devices for biofilms: appropriate materials and fabrication processes are determined by specific geometric and environmental requirements of each application, notably flexible substrates, such as polyimide, with gold as an inert electrode material. The flexible substrates will enable folding and scaling of the device as required to interface with the vulnerable complex curved surface. 3) Device testing using environmental model with data transmission and feedback control: A urinary catheter will serve as a test case. This will be developed considering the unique geometric, bacterial, and fluidic conditions. 3D-printed structures precisely recreate geometry interactions with biofilm, where sensor response and bioelectric treatment will be evaluated simultaneously. A wireless controlled (using Bluetooth or Wifi) electronic system will be developed to operate the impedance sensor and control the biofilm removal using the electrodes will be developed. Feedback-driven dynamic biofilm control will be developed, considering threshold impedance sensing values corresponding to biofilm biomass. The system will introduce a bioelectric effect treatment based on impedance sensor data indicating the formation of a biofilm in real-time. This project addresses the challenge of preventing, identifying, and removing biofilms on a complex surface. An interdisciplinary approach combining applied microbiology and engineering disciplines is required to overcome these problems. Complex interactions between flexible sensors, bacterial biofilms, and bioelectric treatment will be explored. Electrical reduction of biofilm enables remote programmability in vulnerable systems. The impact on system design of key parameters including bacterial species, surface geometry, and fluidic conditions will be clearly enumerated.

Perioperative services comprise surgery preparation, operating rooms, post-anesthesia care, sterile processing and a variety of other services, such as radiology and endoscopy.  The specific objectives of this project are to: (1) enhance communication and coordination among POS staff to improve the quality of care by gathering and using important workflow milestones and introducing artificial intelligence techniques through the use of a smart-app, (2) analyze workflow data gathered with smart-apps using data analytics to provide intuitive displays of real-time information for frontline staff and a daily performance dashboard for managers, and (3) induce behavioral and cultural change in healthcare systems through training and education. While existing  information technology capabilities such as natural language processing, artificial intelligence, and speech recognition technology are promising developments in computing, their uses in health care are limited and thus need to be thoroughly investigated before they can be used in health care effectively. To accomplish these objectives, the research team will work closely with the partnering healthcare organizations, Greenville Hospital System (GHS), Palmetto Health (Palmetto), and the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC), in developing the tools and models which will be pilot-tested at these organizations by their staff.  <br/><br/>The developed tools and models will be widely disseminated among health care providers in South Carolina.

However, the analysis of early brain growth and pathological anatomy changes in brain scans needs image metamorphosis that can jointly capture structural changes occurring in a developing brain and appearance changes introduced by brain myelination and tumor growth. This project aims to develop statistical and computational models to summarize these metamorphic changes from image pairs, to sequences, and to populations. By enriching our knowledge of the healthy brain, psychopathologies, and brain pathologies, this research has the potential to provide clues in devising treatment strategies for brain disorders.<br/><br/>The focus of this project is the development of population-based image metamorphosis that accounts for brain structure and image appearance changes simultaneously. The essential component of the developed model is an advanced image-to-image metamorphosis that allows establishing brain mappings between image pairs. This project develops a novel metamorphic regression model to handle image sequences and estimate age-related brain changes in image time-series. The population analysis component leverages the regression model and statistical tools for classification and assessment of typical and atypical brain changes. The primary applications of the developed image metamorphosis models are studies of early brain development and brain tumor growth. The resulting models could be applied to understand the etiology of developmental disorders and psychiatric conditions, such as autism, schizophrenia, and bipolar disease.

It also reduces recovery time. However, the procedure is more challenging than conventional surgery due to restricted vision, hand-eye coordination problems, limited working space, and lack of tactile sensation. Therefore, effective training and guidance methods are needed to minimize the potential risks inherent in such procedures. The goal of this project is to develop and validate techniques for computer-guided laparoscopic surgical training in a simulated, non-patient based environment. A computer-aided surgical trainer (CAST) will physically guide trainees' instruments during surgical skills practice sessions by utilizing assistive force with augmented reality displays. Guided training will be validated through a pilot experimental study, in which the expertise of computer-guided trainees will be compared to that of instructor-guided trainees. Data such as the time it takes a trainee to execute a particular surgical task, how accurate he or she is, etc., will be collected to analyze task performance precisely and objectively. New scientific methods for motion trajectory planning and path following using assistive force and augmented reality techniques will result from this work. It is anticipated that computer-guided practice will speed up learning and reinforce appropriate techniques, ultimately, leading to better surgical outcomes and improved patient safety. The CAST system should serve as a sophisticated, yet still low-cost, training solution for fundamental medical skills training.  <br/><br/>The specific objectives are a) to refine and implement a memory- and time-efficient hybrid offline-online optimal path planner for computer-guided training of basic laparoscopic skills. In this task, collision-free trajectory planning methods (such as those used in robotics) will be generated by incorporating offline-online hybrid techniques with memory and computational time efficient path repository. Thus, basic laparoscopic tasks can be planned and guided automatically, using haptic force and augmented reality visualization; b) to design and implement an intelligent, adaptive guidance controller for surgical space navigation, where a fuzzy logic and machine learning-based methods will be developed that will take into account trainees' skill levels so that optimal amount of training assistance can be provided in mastering surgical tasks; c) to design and implement visual guidance techniques through augmented reality overlays that provide 'navigational' cues, supplementing force-based control of surgical instruments; and d) to validate guided training through a pilot study. In this task, trainees' performance using computer guidance methods will be compared, using statistical analysis, to that of unguided trainees.

Sepsis is the leading cause of admitted patient mortality and is one of the most expensive conditions (>$20 billion per year) treated in U.S. hospitals. Early detection and timely intervention are the most crucial factors in improving the outcome for these patients, but the symptoms of sepsis are nonspecific and the repeated blood tests that are required to appropriately monitor are time-consuming and performed at suboptimal rates. These limitations significantly degrade the efficacy of early goal-directed therapy.

Specifically, the research plan includes: 1) devising a chemically-enhanced sweat extraction interface, 2) developing disease-specific inference models and sweat analysis framework, and 3) evaluating the framework applied to septic patients. These efforts will converge toward the development of a patient monitoring platform, which with minimal reconfiguration, can be optimized toward other clinical and physiological applications. <br/><br/>The planned research will address fundamental questions critical to advancing the field of sweat-based biosensing.

New technologies are needed to enable in-home monitoring and treatment of patients at risk of developing acute decompensated heart failure. Early symptom detection will help clinicians reduce disease progression and prevent hospitalization. Current home-based management relies on monitoring weight gain, but weight alone does not accurately gauge the fluid accumulation that predicts worsening of heart failure. Atrial fibrillation, a heart rhythm abnormality associated with stroke, hospitalization, and 2-fold higher risk of death, is also common in heart failure patients. Because atrial fibrillation symptoms can be vague, intermittent, and short lasting, atrial fibrillation detection requires continuous monitoring--a challenge in ambulatory patients. A device that can measure vital signs (including heart rate, respiration rate, and tidal volume), intrathoracic fluid status (using thoracic bioimpedance) and heart rhythm will both detect atrial fibrillation and promote quick and accurate identification of the early stages of acute decompensation in chronic heart failure patients.  Thus, the goal of this work is to develop a novel device for in-home monitoring of heart failure patients who are at risk of developing acute decompensated heart failure.  The system will consist of a bioimpedance monitor (a wearable vest with dry electrodes--no adhesives, gels or wetting required) to detect trending to acute decompensated heart failure and of a smart-watch to measure atrial fibrillation. These components will require the development of novel sensor and information technologies, wearable monitors, signal processing algorithms, and telecommunication systems. The long-term goal of this project is to enable in-home monitoring of patients at risk of catastrophic cardiovascular events in order to provide prompt, targeted intervention, reduce symptom progression and avert preventable hospitalization. A wireless cardiac monitoring system that will be comfortable to wear, easy to use, cost effective, and feasible for home use with ambulatory patients will be developed. The system will provide patients and their healthcare providers with early warnings about cardiac decompensation and serious but difficult-to-detect arrhythmias, which can empower patients and caregivers, improve quality of life, and reduce health care costs.<br/><br/>This project aims to: 1) develop reuseable carbon-black and polydimethylsiloxane (CB/PDMS) electrodes that capture bioimpedance and electrocardiogram data; 2) develop hardware and algorithms for acute decompensated heart failure detection, resulting in a wearable monitor with embedded CB/PDMS electrodes; 3) develop hardware and algorithms for atrial fibrillation detection using a smart watch; and 4) evaluate the performance and usability of both detection systems in a prospectively recruited cohort study. The clinical study will target populations, including patients with psychosocial or cognitive limitations, that are at high risk for acute decompensated heart failure and atrial fibrillation progression but that typically are omitted from clinical studies.  The central hypothesis is that an innovative bioimpedance monitor with re-usable, non-wetted bioimpedance electrodes embedded in a wearable vest device used in conjunction with a smart watch will continuously collect and transmit key physiologic data. Devices running decision-support algorithms will analyze this data to identify patients with emergent acute decompensated heart failure symptoms that require prompt attention. A second hypothesis is that a wrist-based continuous monitoring device will provide unobtrusive and acceptable 24-hour heart rhythm monitoring and will augment data collected by the bioimpedance monitor. Heart rhythm, vital signs, and intrathoracic fluid accumulation measurements will be collected via 24-hour data recordings. This data will be used to develop a robust clinical decision support algorithm that accurately detects atrial fibrillation and early acute decompensated heart failure.",,,,,

Integrating medicine, engineering, and state-of-the-art information technology, this project aims at studying distributed and adaptive personalized medicine that collectively learns from an individual's clinical data in real time. This approach is inspired by collective and adaptive learning observed in nature (for example,  honeybee swarming behavior, bird flight formation, etc.).

The sweat is a biofluid that can provide a window to a person's health. At this time, there is no rapid method to measure the changes in proteins in the sweat that signal disease. The goal is to measure changes in these proteins in the sweat before, during, and after physical activity, including measuring levels of stress hormones and immune markers using a low cost and disposable point-of-care biosensor. In essence, the aim of this proposal is to develop a cheap and disposable patch sensor that can be worn on the skin, and eventually become as widely used as the box of bandages or oral thermometer found in most home medicine cabinets. One of the key engineering roadblocks to such a device is the availability of a low-cost manufacturing technology that can be combined with state-of-the-art biomarker proteomic detection technology to diagnose and monitor multiple diseases with medical laboratory level sensitivity. This proposal presents a new approach combining low-cost commercial display technology (found in your TV, computer monitor, or cell phone) with protein microarray printing technology to fabricate a low-cost, disposable skin patch for more effective self-management of patient health care in the home or in other non-clinical settings. The measurements will be available in real time for both patients and their caregivers using smart-phone technology.  To meet this research objective, a fabric-like flexible skin patch is proposed that would provide non-invasive monitoring of multiple biomarkers in human sweat.

Highlights of the proposed development effort include: a detailed proteomic analysis utilizing mass spectrometry as well as custom protein and antibody microarrays for the discovery of proteins and antibodies present in sweat; development and optimization of the  biosensor's optical and electronic components for the utilization of low-cost fluorescent recognition lateral flow assay; development of fluorescent recognition lateral flow assays utilizing identified serum and sweat biomarkers and the integration of the assay with our optical biosensor. This research program accelerates the development of technology that will transform healthcare from reactive and hospital-centered to preventative, proactive, evidence-based, and person-centered.

This project aims to develop intelligent clinical decision support techniques for recommending optimal action plans - including both diagnostic tests and medical interventions - for treating chronic disease, performing multi-step and adaptive treatments, and modifying long-term health habits. In an effort to integrate evidence-driven decision-making with established clinical practices, the research will develop disease-agnostic artificial intelligence techniques that combine data from large electronic health records (EHRs) with recommendations from human experts. A prototype decision support system will be tested on three clinical settings - cardiology, clinical depression, and emergency room readmission - using existing EHR datasets and consultation with domain experts from clinical partners. Outcomes-driven and cost-driven optimized decisions will be compared to current clinical practice. This exploratory research will provide the groundwork for follow-up projects in decision support information presentation, integration with clinical workflow and IT systems, and making the transition from retrospective studies to clinical trials.  Other broader impacts include workshops for healthcare applications of AI, and women and minority students will be recruited and mentored in graduate and undergraduate computer science research.<br/><br/>The technical approach of this research builds on state-of-the-art machine learning and artificial intelligence methods to automatically learn, simulate, and reason about patient-specific treatment plans.  Such methods must be simultaneously probabilistic and temporal.  Probabilistic techniques are needed to handle significant uncertainties in clinical diagnoses and outcomes, much like a human clinician would.  Temporal techniques are needed to consider sequences of future decisions over the course of treatment, rather than decisions at single time points.  More specifically, this project will consider the use of statistical relational learning (SRL) techniques to mine for probabilistic, temporal patterns in large electronic health records, and these patterns will be used in partially-observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) that exhaustively search for optimal treatment sequences. Recent results indicate that SRL achieves superior performance to other machine learning methods in predicting cardiac arrest from demographic and lifestyle observations, and POMDP treatment plans outperform existing fee-for-service practices by reducing costs by 50% and improving outcomes by 40% on a clinical depression dataset.  By combining SRL and POMDPs, specifically, using SRL to learn a disease progression model used by the POMDP, this project aims to achieve further improvements in recommendation quality and computational scalability for complex treatments.  Furthermore, because EHRs may suffer from limited or missing data, clinical decision support tools should follow established practices and expert knowledge when necessary.  To do so, new workflows for integrating expert knowledge into SRL and POMDPs will be explored.  Evaluation will be performed on a variety of disease scenarios in conjunction with clinical partners at Marshfield Clinic, Centerstone, Wake Forest School of Medicine, and South Bend Memorial Hospital.",,,,,

The proposed techniques eliminate the violation of privacy through re-identification, and facilitate the secondary usage, sharing, publishing and exchange of healthcare data without the risk of breaching protected health information (PHI). This new privacy-preserving framework injects the ICD-9-CM-aware constraint-based privacy-preserving techniques into EHRs to eliminate the threat of identifying an individual in the secondary use of research data. The proposed technique and development can be readily adapted to other types of healthcare databases in order to ensure privacy and prevent re-identification of published data. The project produces groundbreaking algorithms and tools for identifying privacy leakages and protecting personal privacy information in EHRs to improve healthcare data publishing. New privacy-preserving techniques developed in this project lead towards a new type of healthcare science for EHRs. The project also delivers fundamental advancements to engineering by showing how to integrate biomedical domain knowledge with a computationally advanced quantitative framework for preserving the privacy of published EHRs. HIPAA has established protocols and industry standards to protect the confidentiality of PHI. However, our results demonstrate that, even with regard to health data that meets HIPAA requirements, the risk of re-identification is not completely eliminated. By identifying the security vulnerabilities inherent in the HIPAA standards, our research develops a more rigorous security standard that greatly improves privacy protections by applying state-of-the-art algorithms.<br/> <br/>The developed data privacy-preserving framework has significant implications for the future of US healthcare data publishing and related applications. Specifically, the transition from paper records to EHRs has accelerated significantly since the passage of the HITECH Act of 2009. The Act provides monetary incentives for the ""meaningful use"" of EHRs. As a result, the quality and quantity of healthcare databases has risen sharply, which has renewed the public's fear of a breach of privacy of their medical information. This research work is innovative and crucial not only for facilitating EHR data publishing, but also for enhancing the development and promotion of EHRs. At the educational front, this project facilitates the development of novel educational tools to construct entirely new courses and laboratory classes for healthcare, data privacy, data mining, and a wide range of applications. As a result, it enhances the current instructional methods for teaching data privacy and data mining, and has compelling biomedical and healthcare applications that can facilitate learning of computational algorithms.

ART is the hybrid of a typical nightstand and the over-the-bed table found in hospital rooms, comprised of a novel ""continuum robotic"" table surface that gently folds, extends, and reconfigures to support work and leisure activities; a smart storage volume that physically manages and delivers personal effects; and an accessorized headboard.

Secondary infections have also been reported in Spain and the United States, raising concerns about training of medical personnel and safety of the entire population. In an effort to stop the transmission of the virus within the USA during its very early stage, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention is adopting a ""contact tracing"" approach ? finding all individuals who have had close contact with an Ebola patient and monitoring the health status of those people for 21 days. This approach requires careful data collection, and is labor and cost intensive. A quantitative measure to evaluate the effectiveness of contact tracing is currently missing, due to the lack of previous experience of Ebola in the USA and insufficient supporting data from current cases. The goal of this project is to evaluate risk detection capabilities of contact tracing efforts for Ebola before the epidemic phase, and estimate the associated cost in potential scenarios. Not only will understanding the effectiveness of contact tracing be important for the current Ebola epidemic, but this project will also provide information for developing contact tracing guidelines and identifying critical circumstances hampering effective contact tracing in possible future epidemic threats. <br/><br/>This project will develop a network-based stochastic modeling framework of Ebola transmission for the local contact network of infected individuals (household, workplace, hospital, airplane, etc.). This simulation framework will allow investigators to synthesize scenarios and activities compatible with daily news about Ebola.

Missed-detection probability, in this case, denotes the probability that a secondary infected individual is not detected before transmitting the infection to others. The team will perform sensitivity analysis to account for inherent uncertainties in different scenarios. The in-silico analysis will allow the following: 1) test performance and associated cost of contact tracing efforts in multiple realistic scenarios and different parameter spaces, 2) propose contact tracing guidelines under limited resources, and 3) identify critical circumstances for which contact tracing is not fully effective.

In theory, mobile technologies have this capacity to provide health interventions in real-time that are adapted to the individual, but in practice the specific theoretical models and decision rules required to determine exactly when, where, and how to intervene do not exist. Standard health approaches use theoretical frameworks to identify and select target behaviors and approaches or intervention. By creating dynamical models of human behavior, real-time adaptive interventions can be developed and empirically assessed building the foundational science of computational behavior. While this project is concerned with creating dynamic computational models for increasing exercise behavior, the approach may find applications more broadly with a wide range of human health issues.<br/><br/>The goal of this EAGER project is to create a mathematical model that will provide the evdience for making decisions about when, where, and how a ""just in time"" adaptive mHealth physical activity intervention should be implemented. Creating this dynamical behavioral model is a challenging problem that requires insights from different disciplines because behavioral science provides insights regarding what to measure, and behavioral intervention strategies that could be used dynamically; however, current behavioral theories fail to provide any real insights on when, where, and how to intervene at the opportune moment. Control systems engineering provides a methodology for creating dynamic mathematical models and decision-making, but this methodology has only sparsely been applied in a human behavioral context. A key first step for developing a dynamical behavioral model is to gather ""informative"" empirical data to estimate the model. These data will be generated with an informative system identification ""informative"" experiment within a human context that builds on lessons from behavioral science about experimental designs and that takes full advantage of the temporally rich data available from mHealth technologies.

Stroke is the leading cause of disability among older adults in the United States. More than 800,000 strokes occur each year and nearly one third of all stroke survivors have significant residual disability, with older individuals generally experiencing slower functional recovery. Current physical rehabilitation of such patients is primarily hospital centric. However, due to economic pressures on the U.S. health care system, stroke patients are receiving less therapy and going home after few months of acute therapy without regaining the whole functionality of their body. Moreover, many patients who have completed their acute in-patient rehabilitation following a stroke or other injury may have limited access to out-patient rehabilitation upon their return home. These patients can benefit from access and quality of care through home-based rehabilitations. The success of the home-based therapy is highly dependent on monitoring the patient compliance and designing the home-based rehabilitation that can mentally engaged the subjects. The proposed research approaches the above stated problem with two novel propositions by developing a haptic-based rehabilitation system that can be used at home. <br/><br/>The project is carried out as follows: First, a haptic home-based system is developed to rehabilitate Activity of Daily Living (ADL) skills in both the affected and the non-dominant/unaffected upper limb of a patient whose dominant upper limbs has been affected by some disability. Second, the research investigates the use of home centered cognitive haptic therapy by monitoring the patient's brain activity. The proposed system uses cognitive and haptic feedbacks to monitor the progress of patient and his or her engagement and adapts itself accordingly. Patient's recovery progress is evaluated through combination of 1) scores related to accuracy and completion of task and 2) subject's level of mental engagement during treatment at home. This evaluation empowers the physician to monitor the subject's performance during in-home therapy and allow him/her to adjust the haptic and simulation in an appropriate fashion. This research hypothesizes that by using haptics the effectiveness of home-centered rehabilitation therapy is effective in empowering the patient. Moreover, it is contemplated that by cognitive monitoring of subjects, it is possible to evaluate and improve patient engagement during the therapy sessions.",,,,,

To mitigate these challenges with the development of new models and computational algorithms, this research will provide the desired personalized monitoring and risk factor identification capability, which is crucial not only for increasing the situational awareness of the individuals who are at risk, but also for providing evidences for design, validation, and deployment of intervention strategies. Its generic nature will also help effective monitoring of many other dynamic systems in engineering and life sciences. The interdisciplinary nature of this research across data-driven risk monitoring, dynamic systems, high-dimensional variable selection, and healthcare, will prepare students with a diversified education background. <br/><br/>The objective of this project is to create a generic suite of computational approaches that can be applied for modeling, learning, and monitoring a set of dynamic diseases, whose progression processes may be modified by exogenous factors such as environmental exposures. Several methodological contributions are expected, including: (1) a novel rule-based monitoring methodology to convert high-dimensional complex biomarkers into disease risk evaluation, via the development of an efficient screening method for high-throughput rule discovery and an optimal design method for risk monitoring; (2) a multi-layer dynamic model that can investigate how the exogenous risk factors regulate the disease process, with integration of sparse multi-task learning to mitigate the high-dimensionality of exogenous factors; and (3) a high-dimensional robust risk factor identification framework that can identify exogenous factors with integration of knowledge learned from historical data, new measurements, and clinician's prognostics. These proposed methods will be evaluated with a practical example studying T1D in partnership with The Environmental Determinant of Diabetes in the Young (TEDDY) study.",,,,,

As daily diabetes care is primarily handled by the patients and their families, the effectiveness of diabetes control is largely impacted by self-care strategies and behaviors. This project proposes a proactive diabetes self-care mobile platform based on the unique socio-economic, cultural, and geographical status of AI patients living in a reservation community in the upper Midwest. The mobile platform connects AI diabetic patients to their medical devices, healthcare team and similar patients, and offers personalized prediction, recommendation, and social networking regarding diabetes care. It transforms diabetes management from the traditional reactive and hospital-centered care to preventive, proactive, evidence-based, and person-centered care. This project will also provide valuable research opportunities for both graduate and undergraduate students, especially from underrepresented populations.<br/><br/><br/>The goal of the project is to develop an integrated, accessible, cost-effective solution for improved diabetes self-management and social networking for AI patients. Considering the quasi-ubiquitous use of cellphones in most AI communities, a cellphone-based platform is proposed to provide smart and personalized service. A biocultural ontology is developed to model the unique characteristics of AI patients. Based on a user's ontological profile, through ontology-based reasoning and machine learning approaches, personalized prediction and recommendation are delivered to the AI patient. Semantics-based social matching is applied as a technical and intellectual framework for connecting AI patients with similarities to form online peer support communities. Personalized self-managed trust and privacy mechanisms are developed to establish secure user relationships.

While there is no broad agreement on the potential solutions, structural reform is on the horizon. The meaningful use of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) is seen as a key to improving efficiency.   Technology solutions including miniaturized implantable medical devices, networked home monitoring devices, and the ubiquitous use of smart phones are starting to enable continuous real-time monitoring of patients as they go about their daily lives. Rich data from these devices form an electronic Personal Health Record (PHR) that captures patient health in a much finer time-scale than the EHR. The health care system, however, is not well equipped to benefit from the impending deluge of personalized health-related data in order to improve health outcomes and reduce costs. This proposal puts forth a comprehensive and systematic approach to intelligently process such data aiming at preventing hospitalization, empowering patients to actively participate in managing their health, assessing quality of care, and facilitating cost-effective epidemiology in the emerging data-rich environment.  In the proposed framework, early risk assessment starts with algorithms for mining EHR and PHR data to classify patients in terms of the risk they have for developing an acute condition that would require hospitalization and/or incur large costs. Risk stratification produced by our approach triggers a set of actions, including tests, additional and more intensive monitoring, and physician involvement. As part of this dynamic health management process, patients can have access to tools that enable their active participation in the daily management of chronic conditions, such as diabetes. Our plans include the development of algorithms that leverage experts? opinions to assess quality of care and the development of a distributed epidemiology approach suitable for the emerging landscape where lots of data about each patient are distributed among many different locations.<br/><br/>The proposed work has the potential to achieve revolutionary improvements in the quality of health care. Risk assessment combined with intelligent management of chronic conditions can prevent acute health episodes and dramatically improve health outcomes. Having rigorous and scalable ways of assessing the quality of care has the potential to reduce medical errors and improve coordination among health care providers.  On the educational front, plans include new courses, training a diverse set of graduate students, involving undergraduate students, actively collaborating with medical doctors, and reaching out to high school students through existing programs embraced by the PIs. Dissemination plans include capitalizing on the BU Sensor Network Consortium and organizing a major medical informatics workshop.",,,,,

More specifically, the research plan includes two synergestic aims: the first aim develops a mathematical framework based on signal processing and a statistical-syntactic approach to learn directly from data the structure of the input. A nonlinear state model called KAARMA (kernel adaptive autoregressive moving average model) will be trained statistically from data to recognize events with clinical significance. Once trained, KAARMA can be converted in a combination of finite state machines and memory tables that can easily be implemented in ultra-low power reconfigurable digital logic platform to design ambulatory monitoring of physiological variables for mHealth. No digital signal processors are needed in the deployed proposed device, lowering power consumption, maintaining programmability and the quality of the digital extraction of information. The second aim is to design an ultra-low power reconfigurable analog front-end sensing integrated circuit using mainly digital standard cells to implement a variable number of channels, multipurpose analog amplification and filtering, and the finite state machines.

It also reduces recovery time. However, the procedure is more challenging than conventional surgery due to restricted vision, hand-eye coordination problems, limited working space, and lack of tactile sensation. Therefore, effective training and guidance methods are needed to minimize the potential risks inherent in such procedures. The goal of this project is to develop and validate techniques for computer-guided laparoscopic surgical training in a simulated, non-patient based environment. A computer-aided surgical trainer (CAST) will physically guide trainees' instruments during surgical skills practice sessions by utilizing assistive force with augmented reality displays. Guided training will be validated through a pilot experimental study, in which the expertise of computer-guided trainees will be compared to that of instructor-guided trainees. Data such as the time it takes a trainee to execute a particular surgical task, how accurate he or she is, etc., will be collected to analyze task performance precisely and objectively. New scientific methods for motion trajectory planning and path following using assistive force and augmented reality techniques will result from this work. It is anticipated that computer-guided practice will speed up learning and reinforce appropriate techniques, ultimately, leading to better surgical outcomes and improved patient safety. The CAST system should serve as a sophisticated, yet still low-cost, training solution for fundamental medical skills training.  <br/><br/>The specific objectives are a) to refine and implement a memory- and time-efficient hybrid offline-online optimal path planner for computer-guided training of basic laparoscopic skills. In this task, collision-free trajectory planning methods (such as those used in robotics) will be generated by incorporating offline-online hybrid techniques with memory and computational time efficient path repository. Thus, basic laparoscopic tasks can be planned and guided automatically, using haptic force and augmented reality visualization; b) to design and implement an intelligent, adaptive guidance controller for surgical space navigation, where a fuzzy logic and machine learning-based methods will be developed that will take into account trainees' skill levels so that optimal amount of training assistance can be provided in mastering surgical tasks; c) to design and implement visual guidance techniques through augmented reality overlays that provide 'navigational' cues, supplementing force-based control of surgical instruments; and d) to validate guided training through a pilot study. In this task, trainees' performance using computer guidance methods will be compared, using statistical analysis, to that of unguided trainees.

Late detection significantly reduces survival; while 5-year survival is about 97 percent for early stage breast cancers, it is only about 20 percent for advanced stage cancers. Numerous clinical trials and community setting analyses have shown that repeat mammography use can significantly reduce breast cancer mortality. The reduction in breast cancer mortality due to screening however, is contingent upon adhering to screening recommendations and having consecutive on-schedule mammograms. Therefore, women who do not adhere to receiving repeat mammograms are at risk for developing advanced stage or incurable breast cancers. Indeed, adherence to cancer screening has been identified as a national top priority to reduce cancer mortality. In line with this initiative, the research objective of this project is to optimize the design and allocation of adaptive adherence-enhancing intervention (AEI) strategies to improve overall adherence to mammography screening, while reducing unnecessary costs. From a societal perspective, this research has the potential to significantly improve the efficiency of adherence-enhancing intervention strategies for more effective breast cancer prevention. Results from this research can inform breast cancer prevention policies at the level of the individual health plan, a state's comprehensive cancer control plan, and also at the national level in terms of guideline development.

The team will develop flexible adaptive stochastic control models that capture key disease and intervention dynamics, conduct in depth structural analysis of analytical models, and develop tailored solution algorithms. In parameterizing such models, the team will use large national datasets to inform the models. Further, the team will test policies derived by the analytical models against some actual policies through a detailed simulation model to evaluate possible solutions and estimate the impact.

A multidisciplinary team with expertise in decision modeling, radiology/clinical practice, informatics, and machine learning will investigate approaches that transform data into actionable knowledge, enabled by a new class of clinical decision support algorithms that actively learn from available clinical data. The objective of this project is to develop and evaluate a data-driven framework for decision support that helps clinicians to deliver individualized patient care by discovering optimal sequences of actions and to diagnose patients in a timely, accurate, and cost-effective manner. The project addresses challenges related to finding relevant information from large, longitudinal patient data; learning sequences of actions from past patient cases; and handling uncertainty that is inherent to the practice of medicine. The new algorithms will improve how observational clinical data can be used to generate evidence that improves healthcare delivery, efficiency, and ultimately, realizes precision medicine and improves patient outcomes. A diverse group of graduate students will be trained in an interdisciplinary manner to translate algorithms and data science concepts into applications that have real-world clinical utility, and with a clear understanding of the technical and cognitive challenges.<br/><br/><br/>The proposed research will create a generalizable framework for learning from healthcare data to discover optimal actions for individual patients with the following objectives: (1) to determine what combination of diagnostic procedures (e.g., imaging, labs, biopsy) should be used to achieve an accurate and timely diagnosis, and in what sequence; and (2) to demonstrate that learning such pathways can be done using available data, allowing the new methodology to be applied in a wide range of clinical domains. Novel aspects of this project are three-fold: (1)Dealing with an environment that is unknown and changing over time in unpredictable ways through a novel adaptive learning approach to discover the most informative features that are predictive of subsequent actions taken in real-time. This builds upon earlier work in relevance learning to dynamically elucidate the relationships between clinical features and possible actions. (2)Developing a new type of bandit algorithm that not only discovers the next best diagnostic test to order, but also identifies additional information that is needed to make a definitive diagnosis. The accuracy and value of diagnostic tests are dependent on many factors (e.g., technology, patient characteristics). The team will assess how prior information from similar patients can speed-up learning given these factors. (3)Providing confidence bounds about the risks and benefits of selecting a specific diagnostic exam to perform. These confidence bounds can be easily understood by clinicians. The performance and utility of this approach will be demonstrated using a prospective study that solicits physician feedback about specific recommendations for a given patient case and learns from situations in which the physician does not follow the system's recommendation.",,,,,

The aim of this project is to develop algorithms that can learn the norm in terms of a hierarchy of meaningful features from data in an unsupervised and online manner. The application testbed is the problem of automatically tuning cochlear implants (CIs) of patients with severe-to-profound hearing loss by continuously monitoring their speech output. The working hypothesis is that deficiencies in hearing for people with significant hearing loss are reflected in their speech production. This project will develop and use unsupervised, online, and biologically plausible machine learning algorithms to learn feature hierarchies from the speech output data of severely-to-profoundly hearing-impaired patients. The learned feature hierarchy from the speech of a patient will be compared to those learned from the speech of a comparable normal hearing population. Deficiencies in the patient's hearing will be ascertained by identifying the missing or distorted features. Algorithms will be developed to map this information into the signal processing strategies used in CIs to enhance the audibility of speech.<br/><br/>The proposed project promises transformative changes to three major interdisciplinary fields: machine learning and artificial intelligence, healthcare, and sensors. It will transform the traditional ways in which the clinical needs of patients are met. For example, the results of this project will provide doctors with evidence-based practices that will better address the specific needs of individual patients by monitoring each patient around the clock at minimal effort and cost.<br/><br/>Hearing loss is the most common birth defect in the U.S. with slightly over 15,000 new pediatric cases each year and societal losses amounting to $4.6 billion over a lifetime. A proven technology for CI tuning would make a significant difference to the lives of over 1.2 million CI candidates in the U.S. and many more around the world, thereby leading to substantial health and economic benefits to society. Other than CI tuning, the proposed algorithms will be applicable to a variety of monitoring applications within healthcare, such as blood pressure, cerebrospinal fluid pressure, intracavitary pressure of the bladder, etc., and beyond healthcare, such as web, machine health, traffic, etc. Continuous monitoring with wearable and implantable body sensors will increase early detection of emergency conditions and diseases in at-risk patients and also provide a wide range of healthcare services for people with various degrees of cognitive and physical disabilities. Not only the elderly and chronically ill, but also the families in which both parents have to work will benefit from these systems to provide high-quality care services for their babies and children. Finally, the proposed project will integrate diversity by promoting teaching, learning, and interdisciplinary research among underrepresented groups.",,,,,

Recent advances in mobile technology have opened up enormous opportunities for scientific advances and new tools that may improve patients' health and well-being. mHealth technologies offer real-time monitoring and detection of changes in health status, support the adoption and maintenance of a healthy lifestyle, provide rapid diagnosis of health conditions, and facilitate the implementation of interventions ranging from promoting patient self-care to providing remote healthcare services. To realize the potential of mHealth, however, significant innovations in computing are needed. These innovations, however, must be closely integrated and informed by close collaboration with health researchers for them to contribute to improving human health. Due to the rich and unique challenges inherent in mHealth, there is an opportunity to advance computing methods in the process of advancing mHealth. A systematic discussion is needed among mHealth thought leaders to outline a grand vision for computing research in mHealth and identify the major hurdles and opportunities for advancing mHealth.

This work is aimed at developing a system that can provide an objective assessment of individually-tailored therapeutic treatments. Specifically, in movement disorders with a long recovery time, such as stroke or traumatic brain injury, continuous monitoring of movement using a minimally-invasive sensing has been a goal to support long-term adherence. A wrist-worn inertial sensor has been the most commonly used wearable sensor due to its immediacy, ubiquity, and acceptance for sustained use. However, developing a precise understanding of upper limb movements based on a single wrist-worn device is challenging. Data from these devices tends to drift over time; that is, a small error in the sensor measurements grows rapidly as the data are integrated to estimate the movement. This project aims to establish a system that allows accurate monitoring of upper limb movement using a single wrist-worn inertial sensor by specifically addressing the issue of drift.<br/><br/>The proposed effort will advance the state-of-the-art in ambulatory monitoring of upper limb motion by exploiting the unique kinematic properties of voluntary upper limb movements mediated by the human central nervous system (CNS) and the physical properties of the musculoskeletal structure. The project starts from prior knowledge regarding the unique kinematic characteristics of limb motion that would eliminate the need for the second integration and many of the drift errors. This model will provide unique opportunities to develop a novel computational algorithms for precise measurement of upper limb motion and kinematics. This study will address the following scientific challenges: 1) development of mathematical models and computational algorithms to estimate the dynamically changing body direction, 2) establishment of a new machine learning framework to estimate the 3D position trajectory of the sensing unit without double integration by leveraging the motor control theories, and 3) development of a sequential algorithm to estimate the most likely kinematic profiles of limb joints based on the human musculoskeletal properties. The success of this project will lead to a major breakthrough in precise gesture monitoring in the free-living setting, opening a new door leading to previously unexplored datasets and potentially new development of personalized disease management via unobtrusive monitoring of motor functions in movement disorders. This project will also embrace the integration of interdisciplinary research and undergraduate/graduate training among the areas of wearable computing, signal processing, data science, and smart health.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",,,,,

Computing researchers have recently worked to understand how systems can support nutrition and exercise, but sleep has been relatively under-studied despite its significant health benefits. The right amount of quality sleep can improve both physical and mental health and is associated with a lower risk for heart disease, diabetes, depression, and obesity. However, sleep disorders are often undiagnosed, and many people are unaware of how their activities or environments affect sleep. Ubiquitous computing has the opportunity to help through self-monitoring, awareness, and identification of strategies to promote healthy sleep behaviors.<br/><br/>This interdisciplinary research agenda will involve the design, development, and evaluation of novel ubiquitous computing approaches to support good sleep health and behaviors. This research will combine expertise in human-centered design, computer science, sleep medicine, and nursing. The researchers' previous formative work with target users and sleep experts has informed design requirements for technologies in this field. The work will focus on building on those results through three main activities.  First, they will apply machine learning to model sleep patterns based on a person's smartphone usage to unobtrusively sense and predict sleep duration and timing.  Then they will employ a human-centered design process to develop and study the feasibility and initial efficacy of two novel software tools to assist individuals in sensing, recording, and visualizing the behavioral (e.g., caffeine use, food intake) and environmental factors (e.g., noisy environment, light levels) that can disrupt their sleep.  And then, they will develop and assess the feasibility and initial efficacy of a new technique and tool for assessing, modeling, and visualizing the impact of sleep deprivation on users' reaction time, cognitive functioning, and mood to help them prioritize sleep.<br/><br/>This research will bring into focus the domain of sleep as a new area for human-centered computing research. The design and evaluation of new applications for sleep will further knowledge of how technology can be designed for long-term health tracking and behavior change, and the designs and evaluations move beyond what is currently being addressed in industry. The technical contributions are novel approaches to monitoring sleep and an expansion of knowledge about how technologies can adapt to meet the unique health needs of different users. Finally, the research seeks to unite the fields of sleep research and computing research to develop solutions for better understanding and treating sleep disorders.<br/><br/>This work has the potential to significantly affect the lives of the estimated 40.6 million individuals in the U.S. with sleep disorders or sleep deprivation, which helps address a major public health issue. In addition, the economic cost of sleep deprivation has been estimated to be $63.8 billion per year. The research will have immediate impact by allowing free access to new behavior change technologies developed through this project. In addition, the research will also impact education by using sleep research as a means for attracting women and minorities to computing research and engaging students in interdisciplinary design teams through student projects and directed research groups.",,,,,

This project, home+, is a collection of robotic home furnishings that fits easily into any conventional home to increase the quality of life of individuals with impaired mobility and cognitive functioning by enabling routine domestic activities. This research project will: (1) establish the needs and wants of older people wishing to age in place, identifying those aspects of the home+ concept that best promise to support independent living; (2) design robotic furnishings, accordingly; (3) test these furnishing to determine how well they interact with each other and with the people that use them; (4) define the choreography by which these furnishings and their users interact; and (5) evaluate how well home+ supports typical users performing ten routine home tasks that define a capacity for independent living.

Beyond the enormous economic impact, they often lead to loss of work productivity, marked decrease in quality of life and disability. A shift from reactive to proactive management of the disease is necessary to improve outcomes and reduce costs, yet clinicians have few tools at their disposal that can help prognosticate which patients are at greatest risk for decline. Decision making is particularly challenging in conditions where large heterogeneity is present in the way the disease might present itself. Simultaneously, due to the rapid proliferation of electronic clinical data stores such as Electronic Health Records and Patient Registries, longitudinal electronic health data (EHD), containing the multitude of clinical measurements taken during routine clinical visits, are becoming available at scale for retrospective analysis. These data provide an unprecedented opportunity to learn about canonical patterns of variability between individuals in the way a disease manifests, and develop novel approaches for individualizing risk prediction. Traditional clinical risk prediction tools do not exploit the richness -- the diversity, complexity and heterogeneity -- of EHD. This project proposes a novel computational framework for individualized risk prediction from modern electronic health data sources.<br/><br/>This project develops a flexible Bayesian framework for jointly modeling the array of complex measurements present in the electronic health record to track an individual's disease status over time.

The obesity epidemic is the primary cause of recent increases in heart disease, diabetes, cancer, and other diseases that place an untenable strain on healthcare and public health. One of the primary behavioral causes, i.e. dietary intake, is a behavior that science has had little success in understanding, much less affecting. Recent advances in remote sensing have provided a new paradigm for tracking human behavior, but obesity-related efforts focused directly on diet and activity have been hampered by not only the accuracy of behavior tracking (especially dietary intake) but also the lack of behavioral theories and dynamic models for personalized just-in-time, adaptive interventions (JITAIs). Current behavioral science suggests that family eating dynamics (FED) have high potential to impact child and parent dietary intake and obesity rates. The confluence of technology research and behavioral science research creates the opportunity to change the focus of in situ obesity research and intervention from behaviors that have proven difficult to monitor, model, and modify (e.g., what and how much is being eaten) to the family mealtime and home food environment (e.g., who is eating, when, where, with whom, interpersonal stress), providing opportunities for monitoring and modeling (M2) behavior via remote sensing, and the potential for successful behavior modification via personalized, adaptable, real-time feedback.<br/><br/>This project proposes M2FED, an integrated system of in-home beacons, wireless and wearable sensors, and smartphones that collects synchronized real-time FED data that will be used to iteratively develop dynamic, contextualized FED systems models based on that data. The technology, ideographic models, and techniques to iteratively develop those models can guide future JITAIs and thus have a downstream positive impact on diet and ultimately obesity. The project brings together behavioral scientists, system scientists, obesity experts, computer scientists, and electrical engineers to address fundamental challenges of remote, continuous data capture for real-time behavior modeling for obesity prevention and treatment. Behavioral scientists traditionally have not had access to real-time data and dynamic models, while engineers have not had the expertise to identify what to monitor and model or what feedback to provide. This project connects complimentary expertise to develop a dramatically different approach to childhood obesity, focusing on behaviors, i.e. FED rather than diet, that can be more accurately monitored and modeled and have greater potential for positive and long-term modification. Fundamental technology research challenges in realizing the M2FED system include unique individual in-home localization, eating detection, conversation stress and mood assessment in reverberant environments, and a system-of-systems framework that includes heterogeneous sensing and communication systems across the family system itself. Fundamental behavioral research challenges include real-time modeling of FED based on past and ongoing observations of FED states and intra- and interpersonal states and events that create temporal and causal impact on FED. While this project is performed within the context of the obesity/FED relationship (which itself has the potential for sweeping impacts on human health and healthcare costs), the project also generalizes a framework, including both an evidence-based system and an experimental platform that extends to systems and applications beyond childhood obesity and behavior modification. The multidisciplinary nature of this work also provides new outreach and educational opportunities, informing (and being informed by) the public and preparing a workforce that is better equipped to address the fundamental human-behavior-centric challenges of health management and wellness preservation.",,,,,

Further, the physical processes themselves are time-variant processes, e.g. the diffusion process changes with time depending on the past history of infusion. Any formal method should characterize the time-variant processes and spatio-temporal variations to analyze the impact of the control operations in medical devices on human physiology. This renders traditional formal methods, such as hybrid automata, inapplicable for patient safety verification. The problem gets exacerbated when two or more medical devices operate simultaneously, exhibiting aggregate effects of their individual control operations. Composition of formal models for individual medical device has to characterize the aggregate effects, which themselves can vary over space and time. To address all these challenges, the PI proposes the development of Spatio-Temporal Hybrid Automata (STHA), that migrates from the conventional perspective of temporal event based state transition to a spatio-temporal perspective where state transitions are instigated over both time and space.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: With the increasingly aging population and a linear increase in life expectancy the need for health-care anywhere anytime is immense. Further, the cost of health-care rises exponentially when diseases are identified at a later stage. Thus, early detection of diseases can lead to better health at a lower cost. SHIs, enabling health-care anytime anywhere, and early detection of diseases require complex medical control systems to be deployed on the human body. Unsafe operation of these medical device control systems can lead to hazards within the human body. Increasing cases of such hazards leads to decreased social acceptance of these devices. Further, it also leads to stricter compliance rules on these devices from regulatory agencies such as FDA. A methodology for providing guarantees on safety of a medical device control system will make a stronger case for their reliable operation. This will help the regulatory agencies to perform a better evaluation of the device and will lead to increased social acceptance. The PI also has a history of employing underrepresented populations, particularly women and Hispanics, at both the graduate and undergraduate levels.",,,,,

Perioperative services comprise surgery preparation, operating rooms, post-anesthesia care, sterile processing and a variety of other services, such as radiology and endoscopy.  The specific objectives of this project are to: (1) enhance communication and coordination among POS staff to improve the quality of care by gathering and using important workflow milestones and introducing artificial intelligence techniques through the use of a smart-app, (2) analyze workflow data gathered with smart-apps using data analytics to provide intuitive displays of real-time information for frontline staff and a daily performance dashboard for managers, and (3) induce behavioral and cultural change in healthcare systems through training and education. While existing  information technology capabilities such as natural language processing, artificial intelligence, and speech recognition technology are promising developments in computing, their uses in health care are limited and thus need to be thoroughly investigated before they can be used in health care effectively. To accomplish these objectives, the research team will work closely with the partnering healthcare organizations, Greenville Hospital System (GHS), Palmetto Health (Palmetto), and the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC), in developing the tools and models which will be pilot-tested at these organizations by their staff.  <br/><br/>The developed tools and models will be widely disseminated among health care providers in South Carolina.

In planning reconstructive procedures for either trauma-induced or congenital deformities, the surgeon needs to consider aesthetics, anatomical function and post-operative health as deciding factors. The most important tool at the disposal of a plastic surgeon is the use of topology change as a medical remedy; in fact, most nontrivial repairs are designed as elaborate sequences of cutting, suturing, tissue rotation and transposition. Mastery of this intricate choreography of surgical manipulations is often the most distinguishing feature between an accomplished surgeon and a surgical resident with limited experience. Any opportunities that a surgeon in-training can leverage to develop this cognitive skill away from the operating room have great value in reducing the incidence of errors, minimizing post-operative complications and improving the quality-of-life for patients. Today, the computational capacity of modern multiprocessor systems suggests the strong possibility of computer simulation aiding in this training exercise. In addition, the vested interest on behalf of the visual computing community on functional modeling and simulation of virtual components of our physical world provides a wealth of numerical and algorithmic techniques that can be leveraged towards this goal. However, especially for plastic surgery, a number of challenges remain before cognitive training of plastic surgeons would become as computerized as pilot training on virtual flight simulators: the contributing communities of mathematics, computer engineering and clinical science need to develop a mechanism of intimate collaboration and communication, and the fruit of such collaborative development must become accessible to a broad base of clinicians as opposed to instances of segregated research groups with access to exotic computing resources. This interdisciplinary project seeks to generate an extensible, easy-to-deploy testbed of virtual plastic surgery simulation, tailored to facilitate intimate collaboration between computer scientists and clinical practitioners and provide a foundation for training plastic surgeons in delicate cognitive skills. The activities in this project combine the benefits of specialized, cost-effective parallel computing platforms with the ease of use of lightweight front-end clients, like tablets and mobile platforms, that can be deployed in private practices or training facilities of teaching hospitals.<br/><br/>The main objectives of this project are: (i) Defining and constructing a pipeline of algorithmic techniques and system components through which the capability of simulating the mechanics of deformable biological tissues at high resolution will be delivered as a network service to lightweight client platforms, (ii) Refining the analytic governing laws of nonlinear tissue, and leveraging them in a virtual computer-based simulation to assess, in a non-invasive manner, the viability of surgical designs and provide preliminary predictions for the outcome of procedures, (iii) Validate modeling assumptions, and improve the understanding of practical algorithmic needs by performing trial deployments of cognitive trainers for craniofacial repairs on actual users groups of surgical residents and seasoned experts, (iv) Provide a blueprint for delivery of computational dynamics as a cloud service for continuum mechanics applications, by investigating the role of network latency and bandwidth limitations and developing algorithmic remedies for balancing the needs of the software solution to facilitate remote delivery. The projected products of this activity will provide additional benefits to the curriculum of teaching health-oriented institutions, by providing easy and inexpensive access to virtual simulators for students in their early phases of study, without mandating exclusive use or local deployment of specialized parallel computing resources.",,,,,

This project will explore a novel 3D image model that can predict the accurate change of knee cartilage, to facilitate early detection and personal treatment for OA.

Removal of colonic polyps is performed by a minimally-invasive procedure known as Optical Colonoscopy.  A proper synchronization between CTC for early detection of polyps and OC for their removal is the most effective and economical approach to prevent colon cancer, which has over 97% rate of recovery with early detection. Through a sequence of image analysis steps, a three-dimensional (3D) representation of the colon can be constructed, which is then visualized by radiologists, using a virtual camera, in order to examine the colon surface for abnormalities and polyps.   Visualization involves extraction of the centerline of the 3D colon representation, which is the optimum datum for the virtual camera.  In this project, a quantitative platform for CTC, based on modern computer vision and graphics, is proposed to quantify and improve the visualization process with respect to image resolution, imaging artifacts, colon topology and polyps' locations. Enhancing the detection and classification of polyps in terms of sensitivity and specificity will improve early detection of colon cancer, a major national healthcare concern in terms of mortality and cost. The proposed simulation platform will have applications in biomedical education and training, and in industrial applications for surface inspection and image-based visualization of hidden tubular objects, in addition to computer-aided manufacturing and digital printing.<br/><br/>Visualization in CTC consist of four sequential steps:  i) filtering the CT scan for removal of scanner noise and resolving partial volume effects; ii) segmentation of the resulting images to isolate the colon surface from other structures in the abdomen, which appear in the abdominal CT scan (e.g., the liver, pancreas and small intestines); iii) generation of a 3D colon representation using computational geometry and graphics; and iv) visualization of the 3D representation, by radiologists, using virtual cameras to examine the lumen surface and detect colonic polyps. Each of these steps are based on solid mathematical foundation developed in the image analysis and computer graphics literature in the past two decades. Filtering may be achieved using anisotropic diffusion filtering, whereas segmentation can be achieved by fusion of statistical and variational methods, which separates the colon tissues from the other anatomies and provides a continuous/connected representation of the segmented colon. 3D reconstruction of the segmented colon is performed by common methodologies in graphics such the marching-cube algorithm. Visualization is an elaborate step, which involves generating the centerline of the 3D reconstruction, and a proper allocation of the virtual camera. The centerline may be generated by variational calculus and the level sets method. Common errors in visualization are due to the uncertainties in imaging (e.g., scanner-induced noise, partial volume effects, prep residuals and patient motion) and patient-specific circumstances which may lead to distorted or disconnected colon reconstructions. These errors may obscure the location, shape and texture of polyps, leading to erroneous diagnosis. This project aims at developing a novel simulation for the front-end of CTC, an accurate sensor planning for the virtual cameras. The proposed simulation will provide unique understanding of CTC and will lead to discovery of methods for image-guided interventions to efficiently remove colonic polyps by Optical Colonoscopy and surgical planning for colectomy. The simulation platform will be applicable in biomedical education, training of resident radiologists and healthcare professionals, and will also promote various applications outside the biomedical domain.",,,,,

This approach addresses the problem of physiological monitoring today that requires skin contacts such as electrodes for ECG, and hence cannot scale to widespread monitoring of patients and healthy adults for years. The key challenge is to develop high-resolution sensing on low-power mobile platforms that can separate out the weak motion signals of heart and lung, from the gross motion of the body and the sensor. The project is developing theory and design for a compressive ultrawideband (UWB) RF sensor that achieves two orders of magnitude reduction in the required sampling rate to make it feasible to realize in a low-power mobile form factor. EasySense employs dynamic compressive sensing algorithms to improve the quality of sensing through temporal integration of information and employs interference subspace cancelation methods to cancel out motion artifacts using data obtained from accelerometers and gyroscopes. The project is implementing all the needed hardware, firmware, embedded software on the sensor node for sampling, processing, and wireless communication, and mobile phone software for data collection, storage, and visualization. EasySense is evaluated against traditional physiological sensors via lab and field studies on human subjects involving stress and exercise protocols.<br/> <br/>By realizing contactless sensing of physiology in the field environment, EasySense will enable long-term physiological monitoring at large-scale that is essential for determining potential causes and early biomarkers of fatal diseases of slow accumulation such as cancer and cardiovascular diseases.

In particular, when a senior citizen attends the dental office for routine treatment, the proposed methods assess the evidence of osteoporosis based on collected data such as dental radiographs. The senior citizen is referred to a formal osteoporotic examination if high risk is found. Towards this goal, the project conducts three major research activities including systematical validation of the relation between dental data and bone quality measurement, dental image-based osteoporosis analysis, and integration of longitudinal and categorical information for osteoporosis prescreening. Decrease in bone quality causes major health problems in the United States. In particular, it has been estimated that osteoporosis afflicts 55% of Americans aged 50 and above. Early diagnosis of osteoporosis requires routine examination since no obvious symptom is associated with diagnosis before serious consequences, e.g., bone fracture, happen. Such routine examination can cause a big economic burden, since the data used in the current gold standard (i.e., dual energy X-ray absorptiometry) is not cost efficient to collect. <br/><br/>This project develops image analysis and machine learning methods for low-cost osteoporosis prescreening methods using dental data.

The first goal is to establish the optimization algorithms and parameters of an exoskeleton control algorithm that suitably adapts knee and ankle assistance based on walking performance. The second goal is to conduct a pilot study to determine how knee and ankle exoskeleton assistance, optimized for improving lower-extremity posture, affects gait biomechanics and neuromuscular control during consecutive daily gait training in children with cerebral palsy.

In-bed pose estimation can be a critical part of prevention, prediction, and management of movement-related problems like pressure ulcers. These pressure ulcers often lead to costly and painful conditions such as bedsores.

This proposal organizes the research to two Thrusts: (I) data augmentation, which synthesizes the large training set required to train a deep learning model to recognize the in-bed pose from an image; and (II) cross-modality data reconstruction, which extracts pose parameters from one image modality to generate data in another image modality. The success of the data augmentation will be measured by using the synthesized image data to train a network, which will be tested against deep and non-deep models trained on publicly-available pose datasets. The accuracy of the pressure image reconstruction will be tested by comparing the results to pressure images taken from a high-resolution pressure sensing mat. The successful completion of this project enables (1) the use of high-accuracy deep learning techniques for robustly recognizing objects and object poses for which articulated 3D models are available or can be generated; and (2) generating highly realistic images of posable figures in one sensory domain using data from another, when one sensory domain is cheaper or easier to gather data in than others.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",,,,,

These degenerative neurological conditions cause difficulty in the performance of daily life activities such as walking and self-care, limit independence, and lead to depressed quality of life. There are currently no quantitative tools that allow us to understand how these individuals are affected by their conditions on a daily basis, and how rehabilitation and medication affect these people in the long term. The advent of novel technologies such as smart phones and smart watches facilitates exciting new opportunities. These tools allow us to quantitatively monitor, and to positively affect the behaviors of such individuals. This award supports research that will determine how to measure the movements and behaviors of these individuals, and then tests a technique that uses real-time feedback and stimuli to minimize the disease symptoms. We evaluate our approach in individuals suffering from PD, a particularly debilitating disease. Research results will provide much richer information on how people respond to therapy and medication, and may prove useful in other populations of people aging with and into disability. The approach, which integrates engineering and medicine, will help broaden the participation of underrepresented groups in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics research.<br/><br/>Wearable sensing and telehealth are promising tools for revolutionizing healthcare outside of the clinical setting. However, the adaptation of these technologies to specific populations in remote settings remains a challenge. The current research approach focuses on individuals living with the chronic effects of Parkinson's Disease (PD). We propose a system that combines wearable sensors and smart phones to assist these individuals with a particularly debilitating syndrome, freezing of gait. This research will fill the knowledge gap of how to monitor and affect the symptoms of these individuals in ambient settings. We leverage electronic sensor design, machine learning, and signal processing approaches to: (1) determine user-specific models of movement from worn sensor data; (2) develop algorithms to predict onset of user symptoms; and (3) provide context-dependent external stimuli to alleviate symptoms.

Currently, screening for depression is based on physician-administered interview tools or patient self-report. While physician-administered tools are more authoritative, availability is constrained both by cost and lack of access to trained mental health professionals. Patient self-reporting, on the other hand, suffers from recall bias and inconsistent patient participation. In particular, neither approach satisfactorily addresses the chronic and recurring nature of depression that requires frequent assessment for monitoring onset and progress. To address depression as a public health problem, there is urgent need for an objective, accurate, easily accessible and scalable depression screening tool. The ubiquitous adoption of smartphones around the world creates new opportunities in automatic and pervasive screening of depression across large populations. The education plan of this proposal includes developing and enhancing various undergraduate and graduate-level courses, as well as disseminating the results to medical students through clinical supervision and increasing the participation from under-represented groups in research and outreach activities. <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to develop LifeRhythm, an automated system for automatic and pervasive depression screening using smartphone data. LifeRhythm continuously monitors the behavioral rhythms of individuals through their smartphones, extracts normalized features from the raw data, and applies multiple machine-learning models for real-time diagnosis. The project applies LifeRhythm to two settings that have complementary strengths. The first setting uses ""high-resolution"" sensing data collected from smartphones, which provides extremely rich and descriptive behavioral data, allowing the best leverage for machine learning models. The second setting uses ""low-resolution"" wireless association meta-data collected passively from large-scale WiFi networks, which eliminates the need of data collection on smartphones and can be especially valuable for a large organization, where it could automatically provide depression screening of tens of thousands of people simultaneously at very little cost. Development of LifeRhythm will be coupled with several tightly related machine-learning research efforts, including novel techniques for collaborative prediction, integrative learning, modeling of temporal dynamics, and model refinement using multiplicative-weights-based techniques. Though this proposal is primarily focused on development of screening tools, future work could naturally develop an associated intervention program. In addition, this research may lead to methodologies that are applicable to other mood disorders such as bipolar illness. The broader impacts will include dissemination of research results (and the annotated dataset) to the technical communities.

There is a pressing need to extend the reach and intensity of existing successful health behavior change approaches in areas such as diet and fitness. Smartphone platforms provide an excellent opportunity for projecting maximally effective interventions for behavior change into everyday life at great economies of scale. Smartphones also provide an excellent opportunity for collecting rich, fine-grained data necessary for understanding and predicting behavior-change dynamics in people going about their everyday lives. The challenge posed by these opportunities for detailed measurement and intervention is that current theory is not equally fine-grained and predictive. <br/><br/>This interdisciplinary project investigates theory and methods to support fine-grained behavior-change modeling and intervention integrated via smartphone into the daily lives of individuals and groups.  Fittle+ develops a new and transformative form of smartphone-delivered Ecological Momentary Intervention (EMI) for improving diet and physical activity. This approach will provide social support and autonomously planned and personalized coaching that builds on methods from mobile sensing, cognitive tutoring, and evidence-based social design. The foundation for this new approach will require new predictive computational theories of health behavior change. Current coarse-grained conceptual theories of individual health behavior change will be refined into fine-grained predictive computational models. These computational models will be capable of tracking moment-by-moment human context, activity, and social patterns based on mobile sensing and interaction data. Using these monitoring capabilities, Fittle+'s computational models will support assessment of, and predictions about, individual users and groups based on underlying motivational, cognitive, and social mechanisms.

The development of auditory warning<br/>cues and muscle clench strategies utilizes kinematic musculoskeletal modeling and human subject<br/>studies to identify required auditory cues and response times as well as muscle activation<br/>parameters that best mitigate head angular acceleration during a collision. Third, active force<br/>reduction specific to impending impact characteristics are implemented using a unique controllable<br/>air-filled bladder. Optimal pressure and deflection characteristics of the bladder are based on<br/>impact velocity and direction, and evaluated with a novel three-dimensional multiscale finite<br/>element model of the human head. This model incorporates anatomical variability in the<br/>microstructures at the brain-skull interface, a region that is critical to predictions of head injury.<br/>The fourth fundamental research area uses the multiscale model to investigate the relationship of<br/>head impact force and acceleration to regional deformation of brain tissue upon impact.

Small data refers to the collection of digital traces that individuals generate implicitly and explicitly during their everyday lives. As the use of big data analytics has exploded, a growing community of computer and information science researchers has started to focus on the capture, processing, governance, and use of these small data streams. The research challenges raised by small data cut across the computer science community and include: 1) Personal data mining and modeling: parsing and fusion of diverse and noisy data streams to create informative, descriptive, and predictive models of individuals and their behaviors; 2) Data Privacy and sharing: constructs, architecture, and policies, for protecting and sharing raw and derived personal data streams; and 3) User-centered applications and human-computer interaction: design methods and tools to create meaningful and engaging experiences for individuals.

The evolution and dissemination of mobile technology has created unprecedented opportunities for highly detailed and personalized data collection in a far more granular, unobtrusive, and even affordable way; these data include activity levels, location patterns, sleep, consumption, and communication and social interaction. However, turning this potential into practice requires that we develop the algorithms and methodologies to transform these raw data into actionable information. The research will develop novel and generalizable techniques to derive robust measures relevant to individual health and clinical decision making.  The team will develop and evaluate tools that convert raw human-activity data into clinically actionable behavioral biomarkers. This demands creative uses of the underlying technical capabilities (i.e., passive data capture, data analysis and machine learning, data visualization, user experience), as well as rigorous understanding of the underlying health condition and management (i.e. functional health measures, achievable and optimal health outcomes, patient challenges in adherence, risks and benefits associated with medication and other aspects of treatment, and clinical decision making). The approach has broad applicability across disease management (e.g., auto-immune, gastrointestinal, depression, cognitive decline, and neurologic disorders), but also calls for tailoring to specific conditions and individuals. Therefore, we will conduct this initial work in a specific context, that of chronic pain management for three prominent conditions: rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, and lower back pain. The behavioral biomarkers associated with our initial target domain, pain management, center around: (i) decline in activity levels; (ii) increase in stress; (iii) decrease in sleep quality; (iv) drop in function, e.g., reduction in travel distance or inability to go to work. The effectiveness of passive sensing capabilities of the mobile phone to track sleep, changes in activity level, stress, social isolation, geographic location and several other indicators that are likely antecedents or symptoms of pain interference has been demonstrated previously. <br/><br/>While behavioral biomarkers rely extensively on passively captured data streams (such as activity, location, communication, application usage and audio), there remain important cases in which self-report data is required to augment or clarify passively collected data. However, the standardized patient survey instruments that assess relevant symptoms and behavior are not suitable for use on a daily basis because of length, question design, or both. Further, traditional forms of self report are often intrusive, burdensome, and suffer high rates of attrition. A new approach, contextual recall, aims to mitigate the issues related to self-report through three key mechanisms: optimizing the delivery of prompts, providing the user with key contextual cues to improve recall, and employing visual input techniques as an alternative to long-form measures that do not scale well to frequent mobile self-reports. The approach to personalizing disease management is intentionally scalable in terms of affordability and accessibility. Passive data collection requires no user attention, and contextual recall is a form of self-report designed for busy individuals with a range of demands and constraints on their time, as well as potential literacy and numeracy constraints. The clinician-facing components of this approach are also designed to work in resource-constrained clinical settings where clinicians are under particular time pressure. The team will recruit patients and clinicians from typically underserved communities to engage in the participatory design process.  The overall contributions of this work will include development and evaluation of: (1) software techniques to combine and transform passively monitored and self-reported data streams into clinically meaningful, actionable, and personalized indicators, which we call behavioral biomarkers; (2) contextual recall that allows the collection of highly granular and contextually specific self-report data to enhance passively captured data with information from the patient perspective, while balancing the tension faced in balancing recall bias and usability; and (3) a methodology that systematizes the collaboration with clinical domain experts to develop and integrate behavioral biomarkers into clinical decision making for specific diseases. We will create and evaluate a modular and extensible suite of analytics and user interaction techniques designed to facilitate iterative implementation and evaluation. These modules will themselves be a contribution, but equally important will be the evaluation of the overall approach of behavioral biomarkers as a driver of precision medicine.",,,,,

The cost of asthma is significant both for individuals and for the society as a whole. It is highly desirable to establish transformative technologies to improve the patient quality of life and reduce the cost of asthma management. The recent development in sensor and mobile computing technology provide great opportunities to establish Smart Asthma Management (SAM) systems and achieve a quantum leap in asthma management. Leveraging on the fast development of information infrastructure, patients can create a detailed temporal log recording their symptoms, medicine usage, and possibly vital physiological signals through an easy access to a website or their smart phones in SAM systems. This unprecedented continuous stream of patient-generated data in SAM systems provides us significant opportunities to better estimate patient condition and make clinical intervention decisions. However, since the information infrastructure of SAM has not become available until recently, very limited work is available for SAM systems. Against this background, this collaborative project aims to develop a suite of statistical modeling, monitoring, prognosis, and clinical intervention decision making methodologies based on a flexible yet rigorous multistate model to describe the evolving of patient conditions. The true underlying state of the patient is assumed unknown; however, there is reason to expect that it could be inferred from patient generated data such as the frequency of the rescue inhaler usage (the time and frequency of the rescue inhaler use is an important indicator of asthma control). <br/><br/>Some anticipated advances include: (i) Multistate model with event intensity function as observations. The proposed methodology brings the mixed effect model and the multistate model into a unified framework to integrate the population information embedded in the historical records of multiple patients and the individual information collected in real-time in a quantitative way.

The novel state space formulation enables efficient stochastic filtering algorithms to estimate and update the states and parameters in the multistate model. (iii) Clinical intervention decision support for patients and clinicians. The salient features of the proposed policy are that it is based on a condition-based policy and incorporates uncertainties in the patient condition model through a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) framework which has been widely used and proven to be very effective in the management of industrial systems.

The proposed techniques eliminate the violation of privacy through re-identification, and facilitate the secondary usage, sharing, publishing and exchange of healthcare data without the risk of breaching protected health information (PHI). This new privacy-preserving framework injects the ICD-9-CM-aware constraint-based privacy-preserving techniques into EHRs to eliminate the threat of identifying an individual in the secondary use of research data. The proposed technique and development can be readily adapted to other types of healthcare databases in order to ensure privacy and prevent re-identification of published data. The project produces groundbreaking algorithms and tools for identifying privacy leakages and protecting personal privacy information in EHRs to improve healthcare data publishing. New privacy-preserving techniques developed in this project lead towards a new type of healthcare science for EHRs. The project also delivers fundamental advancements to engineering by showing how to integrate biomedical domain knowledge with a computationally advanced quantitative framework for preserving the privacy of published EHRs. HIPAA has established protocols and industry standards to protect the confidentiality of PHI. However, our results demonstrate that, even with regard to health data that meets HIPAA requirements, the risk of re-identification is not completely eliminated. By identifying the security vulnerabilities inherent in the HIPAA standards, our research develops a more rigorous security standard that greatly improves privacy protections by applying state-of-the-art algorithms.<br/> <br/>The developed data privacy-preserving framework has significant implications for the future of US healthcare data publishing and related applications. Specifically, the transition from paper records to EHRs has accelerated significantly since the passage of the HITECH Act of 2009. The Act provides monetary incentives for the ""meaningful use"" of EHRs. As a result, the quality and quantity of healthcare databases has risen sharply, which has renewed the public's fear of a breach of privacy of their medical information. This research work is innovative and crucial not only for facilitating EHR data publishing, but also for enhancing the development and promotion of EHRs. At the educational front, this project facilitates the development of novel educational tools to construct entirely new courses and laboratory classes for healthcare, data privacy, data mining, and a wide range of applications. As a result, it enhances the current instructional methods for teaching data privacy and data mining, and has compelling biomedical and healthcare applications that can facilitate learning of computational algorithms. This project involves both undergraduate and graduate students in the three participating institutions. The PIs make a strong effort to engage minority graduate and undergraduate students in research activities in order to increase their exposure to cutting-edge research.",,,,,

Unlike other brain information such as the structural and sequential dimensions that have all been extensively studied with models and methods successfully developed, the 5th dimension, dynamics, has only very recently started receiving systematic analysis from the research community. The state-of-the-art models suffer from several fundamental limitations that have critically inhibited the accuracy and reliability of the dynamic parameters' computation. First, dynamic parameters are derived from each voxel of the brain spatially independently, and thus miss the fundamental spatial information since the brain is ?connected?. Second, current models rely solely on single-patient data to estimate the dynamic parameters without exploiting the big medical data consisting of billions of patients with similar diseases. <br/><br/>This project aims to develop a framework for data-driven brain dynamics characterization, modeling and evaluation that includes the new concept of a 5th dimension - brain dynamics - to complement the structural 4-D brain for a complete picture. The project studies how dynamic computing of the brain as a distinct problem from the image reconstruction and de-noising of convention models, and analyzes the impact of different models for the dynamics analysis. A data-driven, scalable framework will be developed to depict the functionality and dynamics of the brain. This framework enables full utilization of 4-D brain spatio-temporal data and big medical data, resulting in accurate estimations of the dynamics of the brain that are not reflected in the voxel-independent models and the single patient models. The model and framework will be evaluated on both simulated and real dual-dose computed tomography perfusion image data and then compared with the state-of-the-art methods for brain dynamics computation by leveraging collaborations with Florida International University Herbert Wertheim College of Medicine, NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital / Weill Cornell Medical College (WCMC) and Northwell School of Medicine at Hofstra University.

Considering drug discovery today is a complex, expensive, and time-consuming process with high attrition rate, a more systematic approach is needed to analyze the underlying genetic regulation in order to lead to more effective and efficient drug development. This project targets the dynamics of Genetic Regulatory Networks (GRNs) under drug perturbation using hybrid systems, in order to quantify drug effectiveness regarding different dosing regimens, optimal target(s), and combinational therapy. The interdisciplinary nature of this project promises to foster cross-fertilization of ideas between computational science and biomedical research. It is promising that such study would advance research in effective and affordable treatment of genetic diseases like cancer. Moreover, the project will take place at Prairie View A&M University, an HBCU, which historically has a strong national presence as a producer of African American engineers. Ample efforts will be carried out by the PI to involve students in research and encourage promising undergraduates to pursue graduate study. The proposed research and education activities will greatly improve African American involvement in the emerging field of computational biology.<br/><br/>Molecularly targeted agents (MTAs) are increasingly used for the treatment of cancer in recent years to improve the efficacy and selectivity by interfering with specific targeted molecules needed for carcinogenesis and tumor growth. While the lack of specificity of the traditional cytotoxic drugs allowed a relatively straightforward approach in preclinical and clinical study, developing a paradigm to better analyze the efficacy of MTAs is substantially more complex. Moreover, complex diseases such as cancer involved the interaction of more complicated and dynamic biological systems. This proposed research investigates both deterministic and stochastic hybrid systems models to study dynamics of the underlying GRN under drug perturbations in order to provide systematic mathematical analysis for different drug perturbation scenarios. While the deterministic hybrid systems model integrates continuous and discrete dynamics of GRN, the stochastic hybrid systems model captures the inherent stochasticity in genetic regulations and uncertainties introduced by drug effects. A realistic drug pharmacology model is taken into account in the proposed model, including drug pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics information linked through a state-space approach. The objective is to understand how the GRN reacts when perturbed and provide suggestions for better therapeutic interventions.",,,,,

Most adolescents visit a healthcare provider once a year, providing an ideal opportunity to integrate behavioral health screening into clinical care. Although the majority of adolescent health problems are amenable to behavioral intervention, few health information technology interventions have been integrated into adolescent care. With complementary theoretical advances (social-cognitive theories of behavior change) and technology advances (intelligent narrative-centered learning environments, user modeling, and machine learning), the field is now well positioned to design health behavior change systems that can realize significant impacts on behavior change for adolescent preventive health. <br/><br/>Computationally-enabled models of behavior change hold significant promise for adolescent healthcare. The objective of the proposed research is to design, implement, and investigate INSPIRE, a self-adaptive personalized behavior change system for adolescent preventive health. INSPIRE will utilize a social-cognitive theory of behavior change built around a tight feedback loop in which a narrative-centered behavior change environment will produce improved behaviors in patients, and the resulting patient outcome data will be used by a reinforcement learning optimization system to learn refined computational behavior change models. With a focus on risky behaviors and an emphasis on substance use, adolescents will interact with INSPIRE to develop an experiential understanding of the dynamics and consequences of their substance use decisions. A unique feature of INSPIRE afforded by recent advances in machine learning will be its ability to optimize health behavior change at both the individual and population levels. At the individual level, INSPIRE will utilize a patient behavior model to personalize its behavior change narratives for individual adolescents. It will customize interactions based on an adolescent's goals and affective models. At the population level, INSPIRE will utilize reinforcement learning to adapt its narrative generation system to systematically increase its ability to improve two types of outcomes: behavior change and self-efficacy. The project will culminate with an experiment conducted with a fully implemented version of INSPIRE at outpatient clinics within the UC San Francisco Department of Pediatrics, Benioff Children's Hospital. <br/><br/>It is anticipated that INSPIRE interventions will yield two types of outcomes: 1) improved health behavior through significant reductions in adolescent risky behavior, relative to standard of care; and 2) increased self-efficacy with respect to adolescents' ability to make good decisions about their health behaviors, relative to standard of care. Designed for natural integration into clinic workflow, interoperability with EHR and patient portal systems, and security and privacy requirements, INSPIRE will report patient behavior change summaries to healthcare providers. Through multi-platform deployments supporting laptop, desktop, tablet, and mobile computing devices, INSPIRE will serve as an empowering tool for adolescents, making them full participants in their own wellbeing. It will also enable researchers to run behavior analytics to investigate which properties of alternate interventions contribute most effectively to behavior change outcomes. Going forward, it is anticipated that INSPIRE will provide a testbed for a broad range of behavior change research and serve as the foundation for next-generation personalized preventive healthcare through computationally-enabled behavior change.",,,,,

However, EBP guidelines may not be equally effective across all populations. The national mandate for all health professionals to implement interoperable electronic health records (EHRs) by 2015 provides an opportunity for reuse of EHR data to address new research questions that explore patterns of patient characteristics and resources, EBP interventions (actions of health professionals in treatment of the patient), and improvement in health, e.g., the effectiveness of multi-disciplinary EBP during hospitalization and follow-up.  This exploratory project is interested in groups of patients that (1) share a particular condition, e.g., severe sepsis and septic shock or patients with diabetes or diabetic complications, (2) were hospitalized for this condition or related complications, (3) were treated as an outpatient in a clinic during a succeeding period of time, and (4) have an identifiable outcome, e.g., rehospitalization, emergency room (ER) visits, death related to the condition, or condition under control without rehospitalization. These patients will be analyzed to understand the differences between patients with the same condition but different outcomes, with the goals of (1) evaluating whether EBP guidelines made a difference and (2) discovering interventions which lead to improvement in outcomes that may need to be added to EBP guidelines.  Achievement of these goals requires the development of new analysis techniques for deriving insights into health outcomes from EHR data. <br/><br/>The algorithms and approaches developed in this project will advance health informatics by enabling researchers to extract, from the relatively raw and unorganized mass of data in an EHR, a higher level view of the evolution of the patient's health and treatment over time and use that information to analyze the differences between patients with favorable and unfavorable health outcomes. More specifically, new techniques and tools will be developed to (1) create patient and intervention profiles that summarize important characteristics of the patient, their environment, and their treatment, (2) find groups (clusters) and patterns in these profiles, and (3) use the profiles, clusters, and patterns to analyze the differences in outcomes between patients with a common health condition. <br/><br/>Achievement of these goals poses significant challenges. For instance, EHR data in its original form is, for research and analysis purposes, mostly in a relatively unorganized and low-level format, e.g., flowsheets, which contain primarily nursing documentation, have numerous rows of data representing patient assessments and results as well as laboratory and other diagnostic tests. This necessitates the extraction and summarization of information relevant for the task. Because time plays such an important role in this data, extracting useful features from the data across time is critical.  However, the time series involved are often irregular.  More generally, not all patients have the same set of information and information is not available at regular intervals. Furthermore, data may need to be viewed at multiple temporal resolutions, e.g., sudden increase in blood pressure versus gradual, but noisy increase over several years. Additional complexities arise from population substructure, differences in the types of features, incorporating knowledge of prior dependencies among features, and incomplete and missing data. This project will address these challenges. Success in these efforts will advance data mining in the areas of classification, clustering and pattern mining, as well as various types of temporal data analysis, including trend, change point, and anomaly detection.  <br/><br/>The novel pattern mining approaches proposed for this project will help generate the insights biomedical researchers need to make progress in understanding a number of serious health problems and avoiding poor outcomes. Such progress is likely to advance personalized health care and thus has the potential to improve human health and reduce health care costs. Beyond health applications, this work has broad and immediate applications to any complex system for which creating a comprehensive predictive model for complex entities is often unrealistic, at least in the near future, and the best that can be hoped for is to identify specific patterns that provide insight into the current or future state of an entity or system with respect to certain specific conditions of interest. Examples include transportation and energy systems, business and government organizations, ecosystems, sophisticated machinery, and computer / network systems. The creation of the proposed frameworks and algorithms will also directly train a number of graduate and undergraduate students in the areas of data mining and its use in analyzing health data. The results of this project will be presented in various conferences and journals in computer science, as well as those in domains related to the target applications.",,,,,

First, a very significant percentage of ultrasonographers (63-91%) develop musculoskeletal disorders due to effort required to perform imaging tasks. Second, ultrasound imaging is limited by loss of resolution at increasing depths (e.g., in imaging of obese patients), significantly limiting imaging value with conventional ultrasound imaging. Finally, ultrasound imaging is most commonly qualitative in nature, and quantitative imaging (e.g., measurement of the speed of the ultrasounds signal) has been limited. There is significant gap and need for more accurate imaging of various organs and diseases.

Additionally, we explore co-robotic imaging to substantially enhance ultrasound resolution utilizing synthetic aperture reconstruction guided by the robot's precise and accurate motion trajectory.  Thrust 3: Education focuses on integrating research results into education at the high school, undergraduate, and graduate levels, while emphasizing participation by an underrepresented individuals (African American and women) in Biomedical Sciences and Engineering.

However, our current understanding of health-related behavior is largely based on static snapshots of human behavior, rather than ongoing, dynamic feedback loops of behavior in response to ever-changing biological, social and personal environmental states. Rich streams of continuous data are becoming increasingly available through emerging technologies, including wearable and deployable sensors and mobile phones. This data, combined with sophisticated modeling techniques emanating primarily from engineering fields, can provide unprecedented opportunities to understand behavior in context and in real time. However, to take advantage of these opportunities, dedicated collaborations between behavioral/health scientists and data modelers, as well as across different schools of complex data modeling techniques, are required. The proposed workshop focuses on developing new concepts for modeling the temporally dense, contextually rich and personalized data increasingly afforded by emerging technologies. The major goals of this proposed workshop are to 1) amalgamate techniques from sub-disciplines across different computational modeling approaches, 2) facilitate development of a shared vocabulary/ontology to facilitate communication between modelers, behavioral and health scientists and 3) advance the rigor of dynamic behavioral theories to the next level towards causal and predictive dynamic models.<br/><br/>The challenge to 21st century data modeling and health behavior research is to move toward computational, dynamic modeling of behavior that can capture complex and rapid changes in behavioral state and related influencing factors. These new models will pave the way for Just-In-Time, Adaptive Interventions (JITAI) that provide feedback in context, in the moment, when people are most receptive and most likely to benefit. To accomplish this, the workshop proposed here will bring together experts in various types of modeling, for example (but not limited) to systems dynamics, social networks, agent-based modeling, machine learning, and Bayesian inference to work together with behavioral scientists and health care professionals to move this endeavor to the next level. The proposed workshop will follow the International Workshop on Methodologies for Developing and Evaluating Digital Health Interventions, which will be held in London UK, 10-11 September 2015, led by Dr. Susan Michie and Dr. Jeremy Wyatt, sponsored by the Medical Research Council (MRC), UK. The workshop proposed here brings the international leaders in health behavior and mobile interventions together with leaders in big data modeling. This workshop will facilitate an unprecedented collaboration between different streams of ""big data"" modelers and behaviorists to develop new paradigms for modeling temporally dense, contextualized behavioral data that can guide future JITIAs across health and wellness domains.",,,,,

Spengler,10/31/2018,"$605,572.00 ","Jon Duke, Davide Bolchini",dbolchin@iupui.edu,509 E 3RD ST,Bloomington,IN,474013654,8128550516,CSE,8018,"8018, 8061, 9251",$0.00 ,"To prescribe safe medications, physicians use computerized physician order entry (CPOE) that routinely relies on drug-drug interaction (DDI) alerts. Despite the current attempts to reduce frequency and complexity of alerts, the effectiveness of such alerts remains extremely low, with up to 96% of warnings being ignored by physicians on a daily basis. The primary cause for this is alert fatigue, a state in which physicians, bombarded by numerous warnings, become desensitized. The goal of this project is to transform drug safety alerts from oft-ignored warnings to trusted tools that advise physicians in daily decision making. To accomplish this, the investigators are aiming beyond incremental improvement  establishing novel principles for alert design that are based on what physicians consider important when taking advice from peers in their daily clinical work.  The project is addressing this problem with a three prong approach:  (1) determining principles that accompany trusted physician-to-physician advice regarding appropriate medication prescribing; formative studies will be conducted in a variety of clinical settings to identify key factors in sharing trusted advice among doctors and residents; (2) generating novel designs for drug safety guidance that elicit physician trust and maximize compliance and (3) evaluating the impact of novel designs on physician compliance to DDI warnings.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit:<br/>By investigating the question of why physicians trust each other, the project is leveraging a fundamental behavioral dynamics reconsidering the role of clinical alerts, and thus generating new principles to design effective computerized guidance that elicits similar notions of trust. A very important contribution of this research is a more complete understanding of what makes physician-to-physician advice trustworthy in the ecosystem of daily clinical activities provides a solid, long-term intellectual basis for the creation of substantially better alerts for a broad variety of CPOE systems. Key innovative aspect of  this work is the departure from the mere optimization of alerts to focus rather on complex yet crucial dynamics by which trusted advice is shared among physicians. There are potentially transformative aspects of the proposed work, which if successful, could unleash a new generation of drug-drug interaction warnings that will substantially advance the level of adherence in daily medication prescribing.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts:<br/>The outcomes from this project will potentially affect the over 600,000 physicians in the United States who spend the majority of their time in direct patient care, and who are exposed to dozens of DDI alerts on a daily basis. By reframing current alerting strategies, the project results are expected to substantially increase safe drug prescription in day-to-day clinical setting.  The investigators are disseminating the project results through large-scale real-world CPOE deployments and live experimental evaluations available to hundreds of physicians. The team is also reaching out to CPOE vendors, to promote the incorporation of the ideas generated in the project in the current and next generation of products. Ultimately, this basic research in physician communication and human-computer interaction is providing the research basis to catalyze a change in industry practice, also facilitated by the PI's leadership of the EMR Innovations Summit, an annual meeting of national EMR vendors hosted by the Regenstrief Institute.",,,,,

Fluid accumulation plays an important role in the genesis of ADHF.  Monitoring of fluid status can provide a reliable warning of impending decompensation and an opportunity for preventing hospitalization.  There is a need for low cost, non invasive devices that can provide continuous home monitoring of fluid status and other related variables in order to reliably predict impending decompensation in ADHF patients. This project will lead to the development and evaluation of instrumented socks for tracking disease status in patients with chronic forms of heart failure.  Thin film flexible sensors on the socks will measure patient weight, ankle circumference, leg tissue elasticity, and blood pressure in the lower legs.  These sensor measurements will be used to determine if a patient is at increased risk of acute decompensation.  Measurements from the socks will be transmitted wirelessly to a computer in the home and then to a medical provider.  The transmitted data will allow health professionals to monitor the patient and make decisions on whether intervention is needed.  By enabling continuous patient monitoring at home, better treatment outcomes, fewer hospitalizations and lower costs are expected.<br/><br/>The project will address several technical challenges related to development of sensors in the socks for making reliable fluid status measurements. Innovative sensing principles will be used to enable measurement of weight, ankle circumference, tissue elasticity and lower leg blood pressure in the wearable socks.  These measurements will be made without requiring controlled application of forces or displacements and without requiring strict sensor alignment.  The ability to measure these variables automatically will remove the need to depend on patients making these measurements regularly which has been shown to be unreliable.  The basic functionality of the sensors will first be evaluated using in-vitro tests in the laboratory.  Subsequently, tests with a planned selection of volunteers will be used for evaluation of all the measurements from the instrumented socks.  <br/><br/>The broader educational activities in the project include recruitment of undergraduate students for summer projects, outreach to high school students and website development for dissemination of research results from the project.",,,,,

As many as 20% or more of all hospital admissions occur within 30 days of a previous discharge. Such rehospitalizations are not only expensive but are also potentially harmful, and most importantly, they are often preventable. Providing special care for a targeted group of patients who are at a high risk of rehospitalization can significantly improve the chances of avoiding rehospitalization. Estimating the predictive power of the clinical data collected during the hospitalization of a patient and effectively making predictions from such diverse patient records requires new analytical models. This project develops a 'rehospitalization analytics' framework that can identify, characterize and reduce the risks of rehospitalization for patients using a wide range of electronic health records. Specifically, the research objectives of this project are to develop: (i) integrated models that can effectively leverage multiple heterogeneous patient information sources and transfer the acquired knowledge about rehospitalization between different hospitals and patient groups in the presence of only few patient records, (ii) novel adaptable time-sensitive models that make predictions of the risk estimates in the presence of inherent concept drifts in the clinical data, and (iii) new regularization methods that can effectively extract the population-specific risk factors despite the presence of multiple correlations and grouped categorical clinical predictors. The methods are evaluated using heart failure patient records collected at the Henry Ford Health System in Detroit. The performance of the proposed models is compared against the state-of-the-art statistical and clinical tools that are currently applied for risk prediction.<br/><br/>This project aims to provide a comprehensive, accurate, and timely assessment of risk of rehospitalizations, and has the potential to direct more aggressive treatments towards specific high-risk patients. Predictive models developed in this project could be widely adopted and have nation-wide impact because the source data is often available at the hospitals. This has the potential to improve the lives of patients, by reducing exacerbations, and reducing overall health care costs by reducing the number of hospitalizations.

This will require the first multimodal integration of a user model, environment model, and temporal processing with spoken dialog understanding and generation to produce dynamic dialog and emotive interaction, beyond the traditional scripted dialog and emotion. Object recognition, facial expression recognition, and human activity recognition will augment natural language processing to provide current and historical context important to dynamic dialog. <br/><br/>A team of skilled researchers, assembled from the University of Colorado Boulder, University of Denver, CU Anschutz Medical Campus, and Boulder Language Technologies, will work together to achieve the project goals. The investigators will use the companionbots as a tool to run clinical trials to monitor and dialog with their partners to detect signs of physical and emotional deterioration. The companionbots can then notify remote caregivers, as necessary, provide warnings, reminders, life coaching and therapeutic dialog, extending independence and quality of life, and even saving lives. The other benefits of such a system include continuous, annotated data to improve doctor-patient interaction and analysis, real-time monitoring of mental state for remote healthcare providers and, ultimately, real-time intervention as part of a comprehensive treatment strategy.<br/><br/>In addition, this research will promote both STEM practice and research education at the graduate and the undergraduate levels of the affiliated institutions. The companionbots are ideal for teaching the next generation of engineers and scientists in critical emerging technologies, as they permit either a deep focus on specific topics or an interdisciplinary perspective while providing a simple high-level interface to manage everything else. Furthermore, the project will develop related educational material to support others and will provide public outreach to K-12 classes in the area.",,,,,

The problem is complex as the contact tracing has to be done retroactively after a patient is diagnosed with the disease. Any lapse in contact tracing could potentially fail to track citizens at risk and spreading of the disease. Ad hoc tracing, relying on the infected carrier?s recollection of places visited and people met may lead to inaccurate tracking. Similarly, relying on the recollections of individuals who may have come into contact with the carrier cannot accurately identify those who are at high risk and those who are at low risk of contracting the disease. This project proposes a framework that uses existing readily available technologies that can do effective, automated contact tracing without compromising the privacy of the users. The framework has two parts: aggregator - which collects information from the users, and analyzer --- which processes the information to do contact tracing. This project will develop advances in algorithms to minimize false positives, storage features for context and social data that is both scalable and will preserve privacy of potential contacts. <br/><br/>The best current method for managing the Ebola epidemic currently is through contact tracing; that is, retrospectively identifying anyone with whom the affected person has come in contact. The current contact tracing system is time intensive and error-prone. The proposed system will do the tracing automatically, using a scalable, privacy preserving method that draws data from the affected person?s social network and smart phone context. The proposed framework is not only applicable to contact tracing for Ebola, but also can be used for contact tracing of other infectious diseases, as well as emergency preparedness in the case of bio-terrorism attacks. The technologies developed as part of this project, such as privacy preserving storage architecture, can also be applied to other problems.",,,,,

A central issue in physical therapy is the assessment of a patient's kinematic performance. With technology advancement, physical therapists can now utilize commercial motion capture (mocap) system to quantify the 3D mechanics common to many conditions they treat.  The 3D kinematic feedback leads to more accurate diagnosis and faster progression. Unfortunately the current state of the art for technology to measure 3D motion is expensive, cumbersome, and not widely available to physical therapists. Thus a strong need remains for the development of a portable, low cost, mocap system to give physical therapists precise 3D measurements of movement dysfunction. <br/><br/>This research aims to use the depth information from a single depth camera (SDC) to capture high-accuracy motion data comparable to that from a commercial mocap system. While depth-camera-based pose tracking solutions exist, such as the Kinect system from Microsoft, medical assessment demands almost an order-high accuracy than that for digital entertainment. Based on prior medical studies, this project's goal is to achieve a positional error of less than 10mm and angular error less than 1 degree. That is four to 10 times better than the current state of the art in SDC mocap.  For the scope of this project, a new motion capture framework will be developed and thoroughly evaluated for medical applications, in particular to help physician, physical therapists, and other medical professionals to diagnosis, treat, and monitor patients with movement disorders in the lower-extremity.",,,,,

This research project will build an activity recognition system that can be deployed as a downloadable cell phone application. Users will then be able to access a description of their activities via a web interface and can use this information to monitor and change their behavior. Thus this research can be used to address the many health-related problems that result from physical inactivity. It can also assist with other health-related problem, such as falling in the elderly, by detecting falls and providing automatic notification to caregivers. The data generated via the cell phone activity recognition system will also enable large scale epidemiological studies of activity levels and health that, due to prohibitive costs, were not previously possible.<br/><br/>Building a successful activity recognition system will require addressing many technical challenges.

Unlike other brain information such as the structural and sequential dimensions that have all been extensively studied with models and methods successfully developed, the 5th dimension, dynamics, has only very recently started receiving systematic analysis from the research community. The state-of-the-art models suffer from several fundamental limitations that have critically inhibited the accuracy and reliability of the dynamic parameters' computation. First, dynamic parameters are derived from each voxel of the brain spatially independently, and thus miss the fundamental spatial information since the brain is ?connected?. Second, current models rely solely on single-patient data to estimate the dynamic parameters without exploiting the big medical data consisting of billions of patients with similar diseases. <br/><br/>This project aims to develop a framework for data-driven brain dynamics characterization, modeling and evaluation that includes the new concept of a 5th dimension - brain dynamics - to complement the structural 4-D brain for a complete picture. The project studies how dynamic computing of the brain as a distinct problem from the image reconstruction and de-noising of convention models, and analyzes the impact of different models for the dynamics analysis. A data-driven, scalable framework will be developed to depict the functionality and dynamics of the brain. This framework enables full utilization of 4-D brain spatio-temporal data and big medical data, resulting in accurate estimations of the dynamics of the brain that are not reflected in the voxel-independent models and the single patient models. The model and framework will be evaluated on both simulated and real dual-dose computed tomography perfusion image data and then compared with the state-of-the-art methods for brain dynamics computation by leveraging collaborations with Florida International University Herbert Wertheim College of Medicine, NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital / Weill Cornell Medical College (WCMC) and Northwell School of Medicine at Hofstra University.

As preterm birth (PTB) is a major public health problem with profound implications on society, there would be extreme value in being able to identify women at risk of preterm birth during the course of their pregnancy. Previous predictive approaches have been largely unsuccessful since they have focused on a limited number of well described risk factors known to be correlated with preterm birth (e.g. prior preterm birth, race, and infection) and less on combining multiple factors. The latter approach is necessary to understand the complex etiologies of preterm birth. While identifying individual PTB risk factors has brought insight into the problem and has led in some cases to successful treatments such as progesterone for women with a previous preterm birth, this has only a limited impact on the overall frequency since many at risk patients, such as first time mothers (nulliparous), go untreated. Today, there is still no widely tested prediction system that combines well-known PTB factors and is clinically useful. There is, however, a global awareness of the need to discover and integrate the complex etiologies of prematurity in order to predict women at risk. Significant efforts have been made in the last couple of decades to collect large curated datasets of pregnant women. Previous studies on these datasets used relatively straightforward biostatitistical methodologies such as relative risk assessments to measure associations between factors and PTB. However, risk factors are studied independently of each other, which does not account for the multifactorial complexity of PTB. This exploratory project aims to investigate the value of more advanced machine learning methods by simultaneously considering all the factors, to develop better predictive methods. <br/><br/>The PTB data acquired in the context of this project brings together Electronic Health Records (EHRs) for mothers and their babies along with well-curated NIH data.  The data is rich with structured clinical data and unstructured free text that require manual feature extraction. This project, largely motivated by the PTB problem, has two main goals: <br/>(1) Improving the quality and aggregation the annotations for heterogeneous data. The researchers aim to capture socioeconomic, psychological and behavioral risk factors documented in the text of clinical notes via studying the process of manual feature extraction by human annotators. State-of-the-art methods either rely on the expertise of the annotator and/or the difficulty of the instance but ignore the variability in the quality of labeling over time due to fatigue, boredom, or knowledge. To improve the annotations, the project will develop a novel Bayesian framework for human labeling of unstructured data.  The Bayesian model will embed a complete set of parameters including the prevalence of each class, difficulty of the instance and variability in the quality of annotation during the process. If the model construction is successful, then the developed framework will replace ad-hoc heuristics into a well-designed process for producing high quality annotations. This framework would allow extracting reliable features from the clinical text for subsequent analyses in devising PTB prediction models.<br/>(2) Developing predictive models for multiple data spaces. To leverage all of the existing data, the project will investigate the value of using Vapnik's paradigm of Learning Using Privileged Information (LUPI) in the context of preterm birth. Privileged information is a data that is available for training models but is not available for test examples. Data in this project come with two potential privileged information spaces namely the clinical notes and the space of future events.   NICU data is an example of future event privileged information, which is only available for a subset of the examples (only premature babies requiring intensive care stay in the NICU). It has been shown that LUPI not only induces a better decision rule, it also increases the rate of convergence of the algorithm, hence requiring fewer training examples. This is a compelling property in the case of PTB prediction because of the rate of PTB. The project will extend LUPI into a powerful and applicable framework to handle the two spaces of privileged information, while developing spline-generating kernels, to manage LUPI's high computational cost. If successful, this proof-of-concept is expected to yield efficient and widely applicable LUPI algorithms in domains where privileged information is available, such as the financial domain and many other medical applications. <br/>The developed software, publications and datasets resulting from this project will be made publicly available to the research community through the project website (http://www1.ccls.columbia.edu/~ansaf/CING/PTB/).",,,,,

The approach is to combine real-time diagnostic information from select community members via an easy to use, gargle-based immunoassay detection test with more abundant contemporaneous community symptom reports via an online informatics platform. The hypothesis is that the likelihood of a virological diagnosis of influenza (flu) can be accurately predicted for the individual using real-time flu self-diagnostics and symptom information from their community, and can influence a user to take appropriate measures to prevent disease spread. This approach enables testing of several concepts regarding (1) the specificity and sensitivity of a rapid flu diagnostic test for Influenza A and B detection compared to a laboratory polymerase chain reaction test, (2) generation of valid user-contributed diagnostic information at scale (3), potential of real-time contextual data to be used to calculate influenza risk, (4) use and acceptance of this information by individuals.

Wireless devices and health sensor technologies are increasing in use for continuous monitoring and assessment of key physiologic, psychological, and environmental variables and reduce the current gaps in health data. Uptake of such data by current health systems has been slow because of the reliance upon the physician/healthcare team to interpret and manage incoming data. Nevertheless, the large streams of data generated by these devices in conjunction with traditional clinical data (Electronic Medical Records) have the potential provide real and important insights into patient health and behavior. To address this gap, this proposal will develop SenseHealth -- a novel software platform that will automatically process and incorporate volumes of real-time data from sensors tailored to the individual in the context of personal electronic medical records and available environmental data. Such data will be integrated into the clinical care workflow to enable system usability, feasibility, and ultimately utility. A core component of the cyberinfrastructure is a collection of quantitative, predictive models that are sensitive to concerns across age, diseases, and health and variety of patient situations (ranging from low priority with no consequence on patient management to high priority requiring emergency evaluation), and sensor failures. The models will be integrated with a distributed real-time stream data processing system and a complex event stream processing engine to process sensor data in a scalable and fault-tolerant manner. Research at Rady Children's Hospital of San Diego, an affiliate of UCSD will be leveraged to develop these models. In each of the following studies, clinically relevant events (i.e. events that require clinical intervention) will be identified and disease specific models will be developed that will predict clinical relevance or the need for intervention. Incoming data and resulting clinical management activity from studies using various types of health sensors will be evaluated in two different patient populations: (1) MyGlucoHealth application for evaluating the use of a Bluetooth-enabled glucometer (for blood sugar measurements) in 40 youths with Type 1 diabetes, and (2) Asthma Tracking application for evaluating the ability of a metered dose inhaler (MDI) tracking device to track asthma medication use in 50 mild-to-moderate asthma subjects over a period of 6 months. The models will then be evaluated using multiple sensor streams in youth with diabetes (The Diabetes Management Integrated Technology Research Initiative (DMITRI) study) and in a prospective study in youth with asthma to determine their validity, efficacy, and utility in identifying patient scenarios of concern.<br/><br/>The SenseHealth system architecture will consist of four major components (1) Health and environmental sensors linked with (2) smartphone applications that communicate with (3) a back-end Data Center comprised of data storage and clusters doing and real-time analytics and data visualization, which will then provide a comprehensive health picture to users/clients via (4) tailored, programmed user/client applications. For these continuous sensing applications, managing sensors and smartphone in an energy-efficient manner is critical. SenseHealth will include a novel context-aware power management framework that uses both the application-level context (e.g., sensor data) and the dynamic environmental or system-level context (e.g., battery level, next phone charging opportunity prediction, or bandwidth availability) to adaptively control the state of hardware components and deliver a consistent performance (e.g. data accuracy, latency). In particular, data sampling protocols will be energy-aware and will be designed to sample data accurately but only as necessary to provide relevant clinical information. SenseHealth will use Storm, an open source distributed real-time computation system to process the data in a scalable and fault-tolerant manner. The aforementioned predictive models will be implemented in ESPER, an open-source complex event processing (CEP) engine. The models will use ESPER's rich Event Processing Language (EPL) to express filtering, aggregation, and joins, possibly over sliding windows of multiple event streams and pattern semantics to express complex temporal causality among events and trigger custom actions when event conditions occur among event streams. Finally, SenseHealth will fuse sensor and clinical data in a visual format that will increase interpretability and comprehension independent of literacy levels and will provide feedback and ultimately intervention support that is timely and relevant to the user (patient and clinician) based on comprehensive knowledge of data. Open source software visualization tools developed at Calit2 that leverage advances in scaled display wall technology will serve as the foundation for the data visualization component. NSF-funded DELPHI project will provide the data center component to store health sensor data and provide access to SenseHealth algorithm-processed data and visualization protocols.<br/> <br/>The research itself will have direct impact on two patient communities, but the broader impacts of the proposed research will extend well beyond them. The proposed open software platform will be built with flexibility to allow for alternative programming with plug-and-play data processing algorithms as required for various sensors/data sources/clinical scenarios. The results from the proposed development activities and prototyping experiments will be of tremendous value to medical professionals, scientists and engineers who are engaged in planning and developing sensor-based systems for continuous health monitoring. The developed software products will be publicly available as open source products under the Apache license. The tools developed from this proposal will be designed to be extensible so that other sensors as well as models can easily be integrated and impact a broader range of healthcare applications. SenseHealth is an essential step toward providing a real-time 360-degree snapshot of health to optimize patient-centered, evidence-based decisions and to empower patients to participate in their own healthcare.  The project team will contribute to training a diverse next generation of scientists by involving undergraduate students in the development process, both for computer science techniques and medical science research. The exciting aspect of this proposed work is that wellness is a very tangible and important factor even at young age.

Through the UCSD's COSMOS program, simple, fun and hands-on experiences for these students will be designed to allow them to understand importance of self-health assessment and disease management at an early age.

The research activities include analysis and numerical simulations of circuits, systems and algorithms; design and fabrication of circuits and biomedical instrumentation; bench-top evaluation of basic device functionality; and pre-clinical trials of the device in comparison with the current gold standard in hemodynamic status monitoring. The research project also addresses a critical barrier to progress in the effective telemonitoring of chronic heart failure patients. These developments could help to reduce the rate of acute heart failure hospitalizations, which would confer benefits of (i) billions of dollars per year in reduced health care costs, (ii) preservation of elective healthcare schedules, and (iii) reduction of patient exposure to hospital-acquired infections and medical errors.<br/><br/>This research activity will advance the state of the art in EIT imaging technology, allowing it to be used in natural, unpredictable environments, which is critical for a patient-centric smart connected health system. Also, this activity will increase understanding of how to incorporate real-time mesh deformation algorithms into EIT image reconstruction. The concepts being explored are (i) adaptive analog front ends for low power/high performance EIT instrumentation, (ii) motion artifact robust instrumentation, and (iii) accelerometer-derived mesh deformation models for tracking volume changes. If the project is successful, it will (i) improve the technical capability of telemonitoring, by adding cardiac hemodynamic measurements to the suite of telemonitoring tools; (ii) improve clinical practice by providing timely information that is specific to heart function, allowing the healthcare provider to manage telemonitored patients in a proactive rather than reactive way.",,,,,

These high risk infants require specialized monitoring of their physiology not only in Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICU) but also in home environments. They are prone to apnea (pause in breathing), bradycardia (slowness of heart) and hypoxia (oxygen de-saturation), which are life threatening. This project aims at developing a biosensor system with wireless network for the remote detection and anticipation of such life threatening events in infants. The proposed research goes beyond traditional health monitoring systems by incorporating body sensor networks (BSN) along with advanced signal processing approaches, tailored specifically to an individual infant's physiology, to accurately detect and anticipate precursors of life threatening events. The proposed research can have a significant impact on non-intrusive ambulatory health monitoring for infants through a wireless biosensor system that integrates lightweight sensor solutions into the sensing, communication, and computing for monitoring physiology. The system framework, theories, models, and code developed by this project can be used by researchers as well as engineers to evaluate the performance of infant monitoring applications. The project also includes: (1) disseminating the project information and knowledge to the academic community and industry; (2) engaging undergraduate, graduate and medical students, especially women and minorities, into the proposed research; and (3) developing new courses and revising the existing courses. <br/><br/>The current physiological monitoring systems used in NICU consist of relatively large sensors attached to the infants, which are then connected to a data acquisition system with multiple wires. These sensors along with the wires are a hindrance to the clinical care. In addition, the existing system cannot be used for home environments because of the size and cost. While there is an abundance of physiological signals streaming across NICU monitoring systems, it is challenging for clinicians caring for preterm infants to determine pathological states, as there is no method available to translate these signals into validated indices to define pathology. The primary objective of this proposed research is to explore whether a dedicated compact device with wearable biosensors along with wireless networks can be built for the detection and anticipation of life threatening events in infants in both NICU and home environments. The secondary objective is to explore whether computational tools that provide real-time indices of cardio-respiratory risk can be developed to assist clinicians for neonatal care. Specifically, the project is to develop a comprehensive system, involving four important components: (1) development of miniature biosensors that can be attached to infants who are very small and vulnerable; (2) development of wireless devices with efficient communication protocols that can transmit the physiological signals from the biosensors; (3) development of efficient signal processing algorithms that can extract useful information from the biosensor data for risk stratification and anticipation of life threatening events (data to knowledge to decisions) and (4) testing and validation of the systems in real life environment at NICU. The proposed approaches in the project can eventually lead to a medical device for the remote detection of life threatening events in infants and also provide guidelines for the design of wearable wireless biosensor systems for healthcare monitoring applications in general.",,,,,

The interaction will explore establishing friendly rapport with the user through conversation; building such rapport is an important social skill that is difficult for the targeted individuals to acquire. It is hypothesized that such individuals will very significantly benefit from the exploratory agent, by allowing them to practice conversational skills without risk of failure or of making a poor impression. The most exciting part of this exploratory technology is that it puts users in the driver's seat of the interaction with a standardized, objective and repeatable stimulus. The architectural framework for the ""getting acquainted"" scenario is general enough to be adaptable to many other restricted conversational scenarios of societal importance such as job interviews, customer service, and participating in group decision-making. <br/><br/>The exploratory agent is a simulated adult responding in the mature, patient manner of an experienced consultant (an expert advisor from the University of Rochester Medical Center consults on the project). The agent correlates the topic and content of the user's utterances with the prosody, facial expressions, gaze direction and head motions accompanying the utterances. The agent also provides helpful real-time feedback via red/green screen icons about these behaviors, and behavioral summaries and suggestions for improving the behavior at the end of a session. The initial domain in this exploratory project is ""getting acquainted"", i.e., engaging in the sort of small talk that is conventional for individuals who have not previously met. The dialogue framework has some transactional knowledge, independent of topic, to initiate a conversation and to respond appropriately during a conversation. When the user's responses to the agent's questions and prompts deviate from expectations, the agent branches to clusters of strategies including evasive answers, requesting repetition, providing encouragement and prompting further input. The project includes exploration of more general questions such as the architecture required for integrating nonlinguistic and linguistic behavior in an animated agent. The project also leads to new user interfaces that can capture nonverbal behavior analytics reflecting the dynamics of the conversation.",,,,,

Left out of these applications is a comprehensive set of users' clinical electronic medical records, genomic data, comparative data with relevant subpopulations, and data on environmental influences important to health and quality of life.<br/><br/>There are numerous barriers to incorporating such data in applications, the dominant factors being the tremendous volume and heterogeneity of such data, much of it streaming in real-time and spread across disparate stakeholder platforms.  A related problem is drawing inferences from these data. With the advances in databases and machine learning proposed, we envision a new era of health and healthcare where patients, providers and consumers are empowered by data access and applicability that we characterize as personalized population health.  In particular, we anticipate a new category of healthcare applications that infer one's health status - and help execute interventions - in the perspective of one's entire life history and context.<br/><br/>This project is conducting fundamental and applied research in support of a platform, called DELPHI, that enables integrated access and analysis of all data relevant to health, and consequently promotes more rapid development of empowering, data-driven health apps and tools by a broad community of health-related software developers. The platform supports an integrated ""whole health information model"" of the individual that provides developers a single point of access that both (a) hides distribution and data heterogeneities, and (b) facilitates drawing inferences from these ""noisy"" data. The platform enables novel forms of analyses based on contextual and statistical metadata.  Scalability is achieved through theoretically proven and newly proposed database and machine learning techniques.

Mild traumatic brain injuries (mTBI) such as concussions are arguably one of the most pressing concerns in sports today, with an estimated 2-4 million cases every year in youth sports alone. The potential short- and long-term impacts on the health and well-being of individuals with brain injuries are extensive. Untreated concussions can lead to diseases such as chronic traumatic encephalopathy, an elevated incidence of Alzheimer's disease, and dementia developing at a higher rate and a younger age. It is therefore imperative to accurately detect and appropriately treat mTBI, especially among adolescents, whose brains are still developing and more prone to long-term damage. <br/><br/>This research advances the understanding of the relationship between brain injuries and acoustic features in speech and lays the foundation for novel and accurate concussion screening tools. Initial results based on voice collections from more than 300 boxers (25 of which were concussed) have been promising and indicate that speech may have the potential to serve as a new, easy-to-capture biomarker for mTBI. Using mobile technologies such as smartphones and tablets, brief speech recordings from youth athletes are being captured. With the help of speech recognition techniques, each word is isolated and acoustic features are extracted for each phoneme in each word. Features that are being analyzed include temporal characteristics of speech (e.g., speech duration per word or phoneme or articulation rate) and frequency spectrum characteristics (e.g., pitch, formant frequencies, and mel-frequency cepstrum coefficients). Using state-of-the-art statistical analysis and machine learning techniques, these features are then analyzed for their potential as marker for mild forms of brain injuries.",,,,,

The cost of asthma is significant both for individuals and for the society as a whole. It is highly desirable to establish transformative technologies to improve the patient quality of life and reduce the cost of asthma management. The recent development in sensor and mobile computing technology provide great opportunities to establish Smart Asthma Management (SAM) systems and achieve a quantum leap in asthma management. Leveraging on the fast development of information infrastructure, patients can create a detailed temporal log recording their symptoms, medicine usage, and possibly vital physiological signals through an easy access to a website or their smart phones in SAM systems. This unprecedented continuous stream of patient-generated data in SAM systems provides us significant opportunities to better estimate patient condition and make clinical intervention decisions. However, since the information infrastructure of SAM has not become available until recently, very limited work is available for SAM systems. Against this background, this collaborative project aims to develop a suite of statistical modeling, monitoring, prognosis, and clinical intervention decision making methodologies based on a flexible yet rigorous multistate model to describe the evolving of patient conditions. The true underlying state of the patient is assumed unknown; however, there is reason to expect that it could be inferred from patient generated data such as the frequency of the rescue inhaler usage (the time and frequency of the rescue inhaler use is an important indicator of asthma control). <br/><br/>Some anticipated advances include: (i) Multistate model with event intensity function as observations. The proposed methodology brings the mixed effect model and the multistate model into a unified framework to integrate the population information embedded in the historical records of multiple patients and the individual information collected in real-time in a quantitative way. (ii) Stochastic filtering approach for individual patient condition modeling and updating. The novel state space formulation enables efficient stochastic filtering algorithms to estimate and update the states and parameters in the multistate model. (iii) Clinical intervention decision support for patients and clinicians. The salient features of the proposed policy are that it is based on a condition-based policy and incorporates uncertainties in the patient condition model through a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) framework which has been widely used and proven to be very effective in the management of industrial systems. Plans are in place to evaluate the effectiveness of the resulting technologies in  collaboration with clinical experts. <br/><br/><br/>The project is likely to contribute predictive technologies that could help reduce the cost and improve the quality of healthcare in the US, especially as it relates to effective management of chronic illnessess.

With complementary theoretical advances (social-cognitive theories of behavior change) and technology advances (intelligent narrative-centered learning environments, user modeling, and machine learning), the field is now well positioned to design health behavior change systems that can realize significant impacts on behavior change for adolescent preventive health. <br/><br/>Computationally-enabled models of behavior change hold significant promise for adolescent healthcare. The objective of the proposed research is to design, implement, and investigate INSPIRE, a self-adaptive personalized behavior change system for adolescent preventive health. INSPIRE will utilize a social-cognitive theory of behavior change built around a tight feedback loop in which a narrative-centered behavior change environment will produce improved behaviors in patients, and the resulting patient outcome data will be used by a reinforcement learning optimization system to learn refined computational behavior change models. With a focus on risky behaviors and an emphasis on substance use, adolescents will interact with INSPIRE to develop an experiential understanding of the dynamics and consequences of their substance use decisions. A unique feature of INSPIRE afforded by recent advances in machine learning will be its ability to optimize health behavior change at both the individual and population levels. At the individual level, INSPIRE will utilize a patient behavior model to personalize its behavior change narratives for individual adolescents. It will customize interactions based on an adolescent's goals and affective models. At the population level, INSPIRE will utilize reinforcement learning to adapt its narrative generation system to systematically increase its ability to improve two types of outcomes: behavior change and self-efficacy. The project will culminate with an experiment conducted with a fully implemented version of INSPIRE at outpatient clinics within the UC San Francisco Department of Pediatrics, Benioff Children's Hospital. <br/><br/>It is anticipated that INSPIRE interventions will yield two types of outcomes: 1) improved health behavior through significant reductions in adolescent risky behavior, relative to standard of care; and 2) increased self-efficacy with respect to adolescents' ability to make good decisions about their health behaviors, relative to standard of care. Designed for natural integration into clinic workflow, interoperability with EHR and patient portal systems, and security and privacy requirements, INSPIRE will report patient behavior change summaries to healthcare providers. Through multi-platform deployments supporting laptop, desktop, tablet, and mobile computing devices, INSPIRE will serve as an empowering tool for adolescents, making them full participants in their own wellbeing. It will also enable researchers to run behavior analytics to investigate which properties of alternate interventions contribute most effectively to behavior change outcomes. Going forward, it is anticipated that INSPIRE will provide a testbed for a broad range of behavior change research and serve as the foundation for next-generation personalized preventive healthcare through computationally-enabled behavior change.",,,,,

Existing early warning systems have significant shortcomings because of their poor reliability and the need for monitoring by overburdened clinical staff. Almost 1 out of 5 patients are readmitted within 30 days of hospital discharge with an annual cost to tax payers of $15-17 Billion. Hence, there is an urgent need for automated early warning systems that can provide timely and accurate information. <br/><br/>The project seeks to integrate and mine patient data from multiple sources, including routine clinical processes, bedside monitoring, at-home sensing, and existing electronic data sources to facilitate optimized patient-centered decision making. Specifically, the project aims to develop techniques and systems to provide early warning of clinical deterioration and hospital readmission of discharged patients using a novel two-tier system. Tier 1 uses data mining algorithms on existing hospital data records to identify patients who are most at risk of clinical deterioration and readmission. Tier 2 combines clinical data with sensor data to improve the accuracy of predictions on patients who are identified as being at risk by Tier 1. <br/><br/>Key innovative aspects of the project include: (1) new data mining algorithms for predicting clinical deterioration and readmission from heterogeneous, multi-scale, and high-dimensional data streams; (2) an alert explanation system to identify the most relevant prognostic factors and suggests possible intervention based on novel feature ranking algorithms; (3) a novel scheme based on cost-sensitive learning to dynamically reconfigure the sensors for achieving good tradeoff between monitoring cost and effectiveness. The resulting advances in healthcare practices that are currently employed in  general wards offer several key benefits including (1) reduced workload on clinical staff; (2) capability for continuous monitoring of ward patients that can be used to triage nursing efforts in order to optimize the desired clinical outcomes; (3) capability to extend hospital monitoring to patients at high-risk for hospital readmission with the attendant benefits of reducing readmissions by targeting early preemptive therapeutic interventions.<br/><br/>Plans for transitioning the technology to clinical practice include  rigorous evaluation of the technology in real-world settings and broad dissemination of the algorithms and their open-source implementations. Some potential broader impacts of the project include  improved clinical outcomes, reduced patient mortality rates and healthcare costs, and enhanced opportunities for research-based interdisciplinary training of graduate students in health informatics.

Using the analogy of astronomy, connectomics researchers wish to build 'telescopes' that will allow scientists to accurately view the brain. However, as in astronomy, the raw data collected by microtomes and electron microscopes, the instruments of connectomics, is too large to store effectively, and must be analyzed at very high computation rates. Our goal is to research, develop, and deploy a software architecture that enables high-throughput analysis of connectomics data at the speed at which it is being acquired. We will develop the first computational infrastructure to support high-throughput connectomics without human intervention. If successful, this system will allow for the first time the mapping of a cortical column of a small mammalian brain (1 cubic millimeter), and hopefully within a few years the mapping of significant sections of a mammalian cortex. <br/><br/>The solution to the big data problem of connectomics is a new high-throughput connectomics software architecture that we call MapRecurse. MapRecurse, named so because it bears some resemblance to the widely used MapReduce framework, will provide a unified way of specifying sequences of computational steps and validation tests to be applied to the collected data. Key to MapRecurse will be the ability to layout data and computation in a structured way that preserves locality. Using it, programmers will be able to apply fast, less accurate segmentation algorithms to low resolutions of the data in order to quickly compute a first version of the output neural network graph. Domain-specific graph theoretical methods will then check for correctness of the graph and identify areas of inconsistencies that are in need of further refinement. MapRecurse will then apply bottom-up, local processing with slower, more accurate segmentation and reconstruction algorithms to higher resolutions of the data, verifying and correcting any errors. The iterations progress recursively and in parallel across multiple cores, giving the approach its name. We believe that MapRecurse and the data structures and algorithms developed here will find applications in other high-throughput applications, such as, in astronomy, biology, social media applications, or economics.",,,,,

These high risk infants require specialized monitoring of their physiology not only in Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICU) but also in home environments. They are prone to apnea (pause in breathing), bradycardia (slowness of heart) and hypoxia (oxygen de-saturation), which are life threatening. This project aims at developing a biosensor system with wireless network for the remote detection and anticipation of such life threatening events in infants. The proposed research goes beyond traditional health monitoring systems by incorporating body sensor networks (BSN) along with advanced signal processing approaches, tailored specifically to an individual infant's physiology, to accurately detect and anticipate precursors of life threatening events. The proposed research can have a significant impact on non-intrusive ambulatory health monitoring for infants through a wireless biosensor system that integrates lightweight sensor solutions into the sensing, communication, and computing for monitoring physiology. The system framework, theories, models, and code developed by this project can be used by researchers as well as engineers to evaluate the performance of infant monitoring applications. The project also includes: (1) disseminating the project information and knowledge to the academic community and industry; (2) engaging undergraduate, graduate and medical students, especially women and minorities, into the proposed research; and (3) developing new courses and revising the existing courses. <br/><br/>The current physiological monitoring systems used in NICU consist of relatively large sensors attached to the infants, which are then connected to a data acquisition system with multiple wires. These sensors along with the wires are a hindrance to the clinical care. In addition, the existing system cannot be used for home environments because of the size and cost. While there is an abundance of physiological signals streaming across NICU monitoring systems, it is challenging for clinicians caring for preterm infants to determine pathological states, as there is no method available to translate these signals into validated indices to define pathology. The primary objective of this proposed research is to explore whether a dedicated compact device with wearable biosensors along with wireless networks can be built for the detection and anticipation of life threatening events in infants in both NICU and home environments. The secondary objective is to explore whether computational tools that provide real-time indices of cardio-respiratory risk can be developed to assist clinicians for neonatal care. Specifically, the project is to develop a comprehensive system, involving four important components: (1) development of miniature biosensors that can be attached to infants who are very small and vulnerable; (2) development of wireless devices with efficient communication protocols that can transmit the physiological signals from the biosensors; (3) development of efficient signal processing algorithms that can extract useful information from the biosensor data for risk stratification and anticipation of life threatening events (data to knowledge to decisions) and (4) testing and validation of the systems in real life environment at NICU. The proposed approaches in the project can eventually lead to a medical device for the remote detection of life threatening events in infants and also provide guidelines for the design of wearable wireless biosensor systems for healthcare monitoring applications in general.",,,,,

A main thrust of this transformation requires the use of novel computing and statistical methods to model complex disease trajectories using health data. Unfortunately, access to quality health data is not obvious to non-health and medical science researchers. In addition to lack of access, significant challenges exist in the analysis of 'big data' in the health domain.

The goal of the project is to develop a technique for personalized monitoring of the fraction of nitric oxide (FeNO) in exhaled breath, with the long term objective of prevention or control of airway diseases, such as asthma. FeNO is a known biomarker for measuring airway inflammation and the technology studied in this project provides an effective and practical means to quantitate NO levels in breath in a relatively simple and noninvasive way. This work involves the use of single crystal metal oxide nanowires that are expected to improve the detection threshold of NO-selective sensing nanoprobes by at least two orders of magnitude down to the few ppb level and below. A sensor microsystem is being developed that quantifies the gas sensor response to generate and display an accurate measure of the NO concentration in a single exhaled breath. The design of independent component analysis (ICA) algorithms, to enhance the gas discrimination and improve the robustness of the sensor response, is one of the objectives of this project. The implementation of the ICA algorithms and readout circuitry incorporating baseline tracking in mixed-signal VLSI will lead to a low-power autonomous system-on-chip solution for the measurement of gas concentrations from a handheld gas-measuring unit. The head space from cell cultures that have been stimulated to generate NO and CO are being used, along with breath-simulating samples, to assess the performance and reliability of the NO-breathalyzer. The same studies help to understand the biochemistry of NO production in response to inflammation. <br/><br/>The expected outcome of this work is a smart health breath analysis tool that will empower the individual who may be susceptible to airway diseases to stay healthy and that provides a means for self-monitoring of early signs of illness in the home, instead of the hospital setting in which monitoring would require the assistance of health care professionals. The new tools being developed for personalized diagnostics should be easily employed by the lay public to promote their health and well-being.  Furthermore, the device will be especially suitable for use by a wide range of compromised individuals, such as the very elderly, young children and otherwise incapacitated patients. This project will engage students, including underrepresented groups in research activities in an interdisciplinary field spanning nanomaterials, sensor nanotechnology, microelectronic device fabrication and diagnostic instrumentation, biophysics and biochemistry, and ultimately nanomedicine. Interactions with National Laboratories and the medical diagnostics industry are anticipated.

As preterm birth (PTB) is a major public health problem with profound implications on society, there would be extreme value in being able to identify women at risk of preterm birth during the course of their pregnancy. Previous predictive approaches have been largely unsuccessful since they have focused on a limited number of well described risk factors known to be correlated with preterm birth (e.g. prior preterm birth, race, and infection) and less on combining multiple factors. The latter approach is necessary to understand the complex etiologies of preterm birth. While identifying individual PTB risk factors has brought insight into the problem and has led in some cases to successful treatments such as progesterone for women with a previous preterm birth, this has only a limited impact on the overall frequency since many at risk patients, such as first time mothers (nulliparous), go untreated. Today, there is still no widely tested prediction system that combines well-known PTB factors and is clinically useful. There is, however, a global awareness of the need to discover and integrate the complex etiologies of prematurity in order to predict women at risk. Significant efforts have been made in the last couple of decades to collect large curated datasets of pregnant women. Previous studies on these datasets used relatively straightforward biostatitistical methodologies such as relative risk assessments to measure associations between factors and PTB. However, risk factors are studied independently of each other, which does not account for the multifactorial complexity of PTB. This exploratory project aims to investigate the value of more advanced machine learning methods by simultaneously considering all the factors, to develop better predictive methods. <br/><br/>The PTB data acquired in the context of this project brings together Electronic Health Records (EHRs) for mothers and their babies along with well-curated NIH data.  The data is rich with structured clinical data and unstructured free text that require manual feature extraction. This project, largely motivated by the PTB problem, has two main goals: <br/>(1) Improving the quality and aggregation the annotations for heterogeneous data. The researchers aim to capture socioeconomic, psychological and behavioral risk factors documented in the text of clinical notes via studying the process of manual feature extraction by human annotators. State-of-the-art methods either rely on the expertise of the annotator and/or the difficulty of the instance but ignore the variability in the quality of labeling over time due to fatigue, boredom, or knowledge. To improve the annotations, the project will develop a novel Bayesian framework for human labeling of unstructured data.  The Bayesian model will embed a complete set of parameters including the prevalence of each class, difficulty of the instance and variability in the quality of annotation during the process. If the model construction is successful, then the developed framework will replace ad-hoc heuristics into a well-designed process for producing high quality annotations. This framework would allow extracting reliable features from the clinical text for subsequent analyses in devising PTB prediction models.<br/>(2) Developing predictive models for multiple data spaces. To leverage all of the existing data, the project will investigate the value of using Vapnik's paradigm of Learning Using Privileged Information (LUPI) in the context of preterm birth. Privileged information is a data that is available for training models but is not available for test examples. Data in this project come with two potential privileged information spaces namely the clinical notes and the space of future events.   NICU data is an example of future event privileged information, which is only available for a subset of the examples (only premature babies requiring intensive care stay in the NICU). It has been shown that LUPI not only induces a better decision rule, it also increases the rate of convergence of the algorithm, hence requiring fewer training examples. This is a compelling property in the case of PTB prediction because of the rate of PTB. The project will extend LUPI into a powerful and applicable framework to handle the two spaces of privileged information, while developing spline-generating kernels, to manage LUPI's high computational cost. If successful, this proof-of-concept is expected to yield efficient and widely applicable LUPI algorithms in domains where privileged information is available, such as the financial domain and many other medical applications. <br/>The developed software, publications and datasets resulting from this project will be made publicly available to the research community through the project website (http://www1.ccls.columbia.edu/~ansaf/CING/PTB/).",,,,,

New technologies are needed to enable in-home monitoring and treatment of patients at risk of developing acute decompensated heart failure. Early symptom detection will help clinicians reduce disease progression and prevent hospitalization. Current home-based management relies on monitoring weight gain, but weight alone does not accurately gauge the fluid accumulation that predicts worsening of heart failure. Atrial fibrillation, a heart rhythm abnormality associated with stroke, hospitalization, and 2-fold higher risk of death, is also common in heart failure patients. Because atrial fibrillation symptoms can be vague, intermittent, and short lasting, atrial fibrillation detection requires continuous monitoring--a challenge in ambulatory patients. A device that can measure vital signs (including heart rate, respiration rate, and tidal volume), intrathoracic fluid status (using thoracic bioimpedance) and heart rhythm will both detect atrial fibrillation and promote quick and accurate identification of the early stages of acute decompensation in chronic heart failure patients.  Thus, the goal of this work is to develop a novel device for in-home monitoring of heart failure patients who are at risk of developing acute decompensated heart failure.  The system will consist of a bioimpedance monitor (a wearable vest with dry electrodes--no adhesives, gels or wetting required) to detect trending to acute decompensated heart failure and of a smart-watch to measure atrial fibrillation. These components will require the development of novel sensor and information technologies, wearable monitors, signal processing algorithms, and telecommunication systems. The long-term goal of this project is to enable in-home monitoring of patients at risk of catastrophic cardiovascular events in order to provide prompt, targeted intervention, reduce symptom progression and avert preventable hospitalization. A wireless cardiac monitoring system that will be comfortable to wear, easy to use, cost effective, and feasible for home use with ambulatory patients will be developed. The system will provide patients and their healthcare providers with early warnings about cardiac decompensation and serious but difficult-to-detect arrhythmias, which can empower patients and caregivers, improve quality of life, and reduce health care costs.<br/><br/>This project aims to: 1) develop reuseable carbon-black and polydimethylsiloxane (CB/PDMS) electrodes that capture bioimpedance and electrocardiogram data; 2) develop hardware and algorithms for acute decompensated heart failure detection, resulting in a wearable monitor with embedded CB/PDMS electrodes; 3) develop hardware and algorithms for atrial fibrillation detection using a smart watch; and 4) evaluate the performance and usability of both detection systems in a prospectively recruited cohort study. The clinical study will target populations, including patients with psychosocial or cognitive limitations, that are at high risk for acute decompensated heart failure and atrial fibrillation progression but that typically are omitted from clinical studies.  The central hypothesis is that an innovative bioimpedance monitor with re-usable, non-wetted bioimpedance electrodes embedded in a wearable vest device used in conjunction with a smart watch will continuously collect and transmit key physiologic data. Devices running decision-support algorithms will analyze this data to identify patients with emergent acute decompensated heart failure symptoms that require prompt attention. A second hypothesis is that a wrist-based continuous monitoring device will provide unobtrusive and acceptable 24-hour heart rhythm monitoring and will augment data collected by the bioimpedance monitor. Heart rhythm, vital signs, and intrathoracic fluid accumulation measurements will be collected via 24-hour data recordings. This data will be used to develop a robust clinical decision support algorithm that accurately detects atrial fibrillation and early acute decompensated heart failure.",,,,,

The approach is to combine real-time diagnostic information from select community members via an easy to use, gargle-based immunoassay detection test with more abundant contemporaneous community symptom reports via an online informatics platform. The hypothesis is that the likelihood of a virological diagnosis of influenza (flu) can be accurately predicted for the individual using real-time flu self-diagnostics and symptom information from their community, and can influence a user to take appropriate measures to prevent disease spread. This approach enables testing of several concepts regarding (1) the specificity and sensitivity of a rapid flu diagnostic test for Influenza A and B detection compared to a laboratory polymerase chain reaction test, (2) generation of valid user-contributed diagnostic information at scale (3), potential of real-time contextual data to be used to calculate influenza risk, (4) use and acceptance of this information by individuals. The team brings together experience in building and studying novel crowdsourced data sources for disease surveillance and expertise in software, graphic design, epidemiology, medicine, and engineering, to develop user-friendly systems that the community will employ at scale.<br/><br/>The proposed system has substantial potential for beneficial societal impact through acertaining and changing the way people approach healthcare. Empowering individuals to generate and act on health information impresses on them the importance of surveillance and educates them to become more involved and accountable for their health. In order to maximize the impact and sustainability of the system, this system also functions as an educational tool. Clear open communication of anonymized and privacy-protected data to the general public in an easy to interpret manner will assist individuals, policy-makers and other researchers in using contextual disease risk information.

This study plans to investigate how gaming peripherals can be used as an inexpensive means to enhance balance rehabilitation by providing real-time, quantitative visual feedback to both the patient and the therapist. Specifically, the project is planning to 1) develop a low-cost instrumentation and visualization platform centered around the Nintendo Wii Balance Board, 2) use this platform to quantify the effects of visual feedback on both patients and therapists during balance retraining, and 3) develop the ability to predict patient functional outcomes in real time from data collected during typical rehabilitation activities.

For one, most Americans engage in daily driving, and patient's time spent in vehicles is a missed opportunity to monitor their condition and general wellbeing. The goal of this project is to develop and evaluate technology for automatic in-vehicle monitoring of early symptoms of medical conditions and disrupted medications of patients, and to provide preventive care. Specifically, in this project we will focus on Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in teenagers and young adults, a prevalent chronic medical condition which when uncontrolled has the potential for known negative health and quality of life consequences. The approach of using driving behavior to monitor ADHD symptoms could be applied to many other medical conditions (such as diabetes, failing eyesight, intoxication, fatigue or heart attacks) thereby transforming medical management into real-time sensing and management. Identification of all these conditions from driving behavior and alerting the proper agent could transform how we think about health monitoring and result in saved lives and reduced injuries.<br/><br/>The main goal of this project is to leverage the large amounts of health data that can be collected while driving via machine learning, in order to detect subtle changes in behavior due to out-of-control ADHD symptoms that can, for example, indicate the onset of episodes of inattention before they happen. Via lab-based driving simulator as well as on-road studies, the research team will investigate the individualized behaviors and patterns in vehicle control behaviors that are characteristic of ADHD patients under various states of medication usage. The team will develop a machine learning framework based on case-based and context-based reasoning to match the current driving behavior of the patient with previously recorded driving behavior corresponding to different ADHD symptoms. The key machine learning challenge is to define appropriate similarity measures to compare driving behavior that take into account the key distinctive features of ADHD driving behavior identified during our study. The team will evaluate the accuracy with which the proposed approach can identify and distinguish between different out-of-control ADHD symptoms, which are the implications for long-term handling of ADHD patients, via driving simulator experiments as well as using instrumented cars with real patients.",,,,,

Contemporary research emphasizes two central processes by which sleep affects our daily lives: Memory-consolidation and emotional regulation. However, the ability of lab-based sleep research to fully characterize the role of sleep in brain function has been hampered by experimental requirements that heretofore have necessitated subjects spending a night or two in a sleep lab wired to an EEG recorder, a setting of limited ecological validity that is usually practical for only one or two nights. These requirements limit our ability to answer important questions regarding the long-term effects of sleep on cognition and mood. This project aims to answer these questions using: (i) Long-term Mobile Sleep and Activity Monitoring to enable the economical, practical, and parallel assessment of sleep patterns of multiple participants in their own homes for several weeks; and (ii) Mobile Individualized Cognitive Assessment to deliver twice-daily short cognitive tests and other self-assessments in participants' homes. The project aims to develop a smart health approach that integrates these two technologies to assess the effect of sleep-wake patterns on the cognitive performance of participants for a period of several weeks, thus obtaining the necessary data needed to answer the research questions regarding the long-term effects of sleep on cognition and mood including: (i) What is the cumulative effect, over many days, of fluctuations in sleep patterns on cognitive and emotional wellbeing? (ii) What are the effects of sleep on the gradual consolidation of memory in activities which require ongoing practice for days or weeks to master? <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: Anticipated results of the project include answers to important unanswered questions about the complex interactions between natural fluctuations in sleep and their influence on cognitive and emotional well-being through innovations in (i) Utilization of mobile sleep, activity, and cognitive assessments to allow long-term studies to take place in participants' homes, (ii) Use of cognitive tasks that have previously been validated in a wide range of clinical populations, and which measure subtle variations in two key brain regions involved in sleep-related changes in cognition: the basal ganglia and medial temporal lobe. (3) Application of mathematical model-based methods for deriving learning strategies used by participants to provide a novel and parsimonious approach to analyzing and interpreting large sets of learning data from the cognitive assessments to extract the key neuro-cognitive parameters which can be related to variations in sleep patterns.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: Integrating mobile sleep monitoring with cognitive and emotional assessments will further the SHB goal of empowering patient-centric wellness using unobtrusive monitoring of individual baselines. Mobile sleep monitoring may be especially useful for impaired individuals for whom a sleep-lab is not viable. The project offers enhanced research-based training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students, including members of under-represented groups, at Rutgers University.

This robotic orthosis actively assists the user's joint motion according to his or her motion intent, and thus enables the user to perform certain critical, power-consuming tasks (such as the sit-to-stand motion) independently. The orthosis is powered with a high-performance actuation approach, namely chemo-fluidic actuation, which combines the high-power-density pneumatic actuators with a high-energy-density monopropellant-based pneumatic supply. In addition to the new actuation approach, the orthosis also features a new structure and user interface for effective load transfer and easy donning-doffing; and an effective motion control algorithm to enable interactive power assist according to the user's motion intent. With the portable power-assist orthosis, the users reduce the reliance on the assistance by caregivers, enjoy a significantly improved life quality, and stay physically active to avoid the aforementioned issues associated with the sedentary life style.<br/><br/>This project has broader impact to assistive technologies and can improve mobility of elderly individuals and people suffering from the impaired mobility due to lower-extremity weakness.

The need for the development of such technologies is underscored by the aging of the population, the cost of formal health care, and the importance that individuals place on remaining independent in their own homes. The goal of this project is to design, implement, and evaluate in-home techniques for generating reports of activities and social interactions that are useful for monitoring well being and for automating intervention strategies for persons with dementia. The plan is to design machine learning techniques that make effective use of sensor data to perform automated activity monitoring and prompting-based interventions that are beneficial for the residents as well as for their caregivers and family. The environment is human-centric because it learns information about its human residents and uses this information to provide activity-aware monitoring and intervention services. By transforming everyday environments into smart environments, many older adults with cognitive and physical impairment can lead independent lives in their own homes. A key component of this project is an evaluation of the technologies in actual homes with volunteer older adults and thus will assess the technologies for acceptance with the target population. <br/><br/>This project addresses NSF?s Smart Health and Wellbeing goal of leveraging computational expertise leading to fundamental advances in the development of algorithms to create improvements in safe, effective, and patient-centered health and wellness services.

The biggest promise for improved results for patients lies in the long-term, ambulatory monitoring of patients with chronic illnesses to help doctors and patients identify health issues before they reach a crisis stage. This project pursues the design of garments for ambulatory health monitoring that have the look and feel of every day clothing, together with an approach to monitoring that removes some of the barriers to patient compliance by automatically annotating physiological data with activities and motions, collecting data only during specific conditions, and having minimal impact on daily routine. The intellectual merits lie in the algorithms, design methodologies, and evaluation methodologies that enable wear-and-forget garments for ambulatory health monitoring. The approach developed by this project uses a computationally intensive pose estimation algorithm that automatically adapts a more computationally efficient algorithm for activity classification. This project addresses the challenges of providing garments that look and feel like everyday clothing by developing design and evaluation methodologies for incorporating fiber-based sensors into garments. These have significant advantages over discrete sensors by being woven or sewn into the fabric, covering much larger areas of a garment, and draping naturally.

Diabetes is a chronic disease, which must be treated and managed over a lifetime. In type 1 diabetes, the pancreas does not produce insulin, an essential hormone needed to convert food into energy. The disease is treated with insulin and managed by monitoring and controlling blood glucose levels. Good blood glucose control is key to avoiding serious diabetic complications, but achieving and maintaining good blood glucose control is difficult. Patients are highly individual in their responses to treatment and to life events that affect blood glucose levels. Large volumes of blood glucose data are collected automatically, but automated analysis is lacking. Patients do not always know when problems are impending; problems occurring while patients are asleep are especially dangerous. Machine learning models that predict blood glucose levels would enable or facilitate new applications of direct benefit to patients, including: alerts to immediately notify patients of impending problems; decision support systems recommending actions to prevent problems; and educational simulations showing the effects of different treatment choices or lifestyle options on blood glucose levels.<br/><br/>The task of blood glucose prediction is approached as a time series forecasting problem. Blood glucose is predicted based on a patient's prior blood glucose levels, insulin data, meal data, exercise data, sleep patterns and work schedules. Batch and incremental time series regression models, including support vector machines and neural networks, are being investigated. To account for individual patient differences, separate models are trained for each patient. However, transfer learning may enable data from multiple patients to aid in building models for patients with limited historical data. Models are sought that are robust in the face of imperfect data, including missing life events, inaccurately recorded life events, and noisy glucose sensors. Disjoint sets of training and testing data extracted from non-overlapping time intervals are used to build models that are compared against baselines such as autoregressive integrated moving average models. Standard metrics for comparing models, such as root mean square error and coefficient of determination, will be supplemented with domain dependent measures of goodness, including the Clarke error grid.<br/><br/>This work aims to improve the overall health and wellbeing of the nearly two million Americans with type 1 diabetes. Predicting blood glucose problems in advance gives patients time to take steps to prevent the predicted problems from occurring. This improves blood glucose control, which is known to reduce the risk of serious diabetic complications, including blindness, amputations, kidney disease, strokes, heart attacks, and death from severe hypoglycemia. In addition, this research project forms the cornerstone of a new Smart Health and Wellbeing Laboratory at Ohio University. This new laboratory is designed to promote further interdisciplinary research among computer scientists and health care professionals as well as to attract more women to careers in computer science.

Many are expected to need physical and cognitive assistance, and all will need additional healthcare. Shortages in primary care physicians, nurses, and managed care facility space and staff are already an issue today, creating a niche for assistive technologies to fill the care gap. A growing body of research shows that certain behavior patterns have a positive impact on longevity and wellness, including regular physical exercise, social interaction, and cognitive engagement. This project aims to develop and evaluate socially assistive human-machine interaction techniques that influence the user to engage in and comply with wellness-promoting behaviors in the home or nursing home in order to enhance longevity and quality of life.<br/>This work is focused on developing socially assistive systems (SAS) using peer-level human-machine interaction in which the machine serves in the role of a knowledgeable embodied agent capable of providing time-extended, sustained, and engaging interaction. The research focuses on two types of wellness-promoting human-machine interactions: 1) exercise sessions (cognitive and/or physical) and 2) socializing sessions. For one-on-one exercise sessions, the project is developing SAS capabilities that provide exercise monitoring, coaching, and motivation. For socialization, the research is developing SAS capabilities that provide social interaction and friendly reminders and encouragement to comply with health regimens (taking medicine, being physically active) and healthy habits (calling family, meeting friends). The two types of interactions share the common goal of influencing human behavior, and the main contribution of the research is the set of methods and algorithms for influencing behavior though human-machine interaction. This is achieved through a novel two-fold approach: 1) adaptive interaction steering for short-term interactions, and 2) motivation and coaching of behavior in longer-term interactions to maintain engagement and enhance task performance. The embodiment of the SAS is leveraged to maximize engagement and compliance; a key focus of the work is on developing a comprehensive method for natural, persuasive and engaging embodied communication. The methods and algorithms being developed are general, and will be implemented and tested on both computer-based and robot-based agents. In this way the work validates the developed methods on multiple technology platforms and embodiments, and compares their relative effectiveness and acceptability by the intended user population. The specifics of the implementation are informed by an early focus group with elderly participants, the target user population. The developed techniques are being implemented in both human-computer interaction (HCI) and human-robot interaction (HRI) versions, and are being evaluated with a large group of elderly users interacting with the SAS implementations over a multi-week user study. The work is focused on generating methods, algorithms, and a large corpus of multi-modal data (video, audio, and questionnaires) for grounding continued research into health and wellness-relevant HRI and HCI.<br/> This project aims to address a component of the nationally recognized healthcare challenge of promoting wellness and longevity in the aging population. Beyond basic algorithm and method development, the project implements and tests real-world socially assistive systems, both computer-based and robot-based, with a large population of elderly retirement home residents. The project is expected to produce insights useful for both research and healthcare product development for addressing this growing segment of the population. In addition to the socially relevant research focus, the project team is also engaged in a comprehensive program of K-12 outreach activities, which use robotics to promote STEM topic learning using the health theme of the proposal. The project involves inner city K-12 teachers and students in annual open houses, assemblies, and workshops that provide hands-on experiences with assistive systems for the elderly, as well as take-home materials for continued learning. The project team includes PhD students, undergraduates, and K-12 volunteers, and establishes a mentoring pipeline so that university students are both mentored and serve as mentors and role models for their younger peers.",,,,,

The main objective of the workshop is to identify challenges in using computing and networking and information technology in support of behavioral change that would enable healthcare to be more proactive and preventive. <br/><br/> The proposed workshop plans to address a number of open fundamental issues at the intersection of networking, information technology and behavior modification. The workshop is striving to identify the fundamental barriers that currently hamper the use of networking and information technology, how they can be used to mediate processes enabling behavioral change, as well as new methods for the real-time assessment and modeling of behavior, affective states, and the environments in which these behaviors occur. <br/><br/>Reactionary ""sick-care"" systems that fail to prevent disease have become financially unsustainable. It is a global imperative that healthcare is transformed to a preemptive model that advances health ""up front."" The global burden of disease is tightly related to conditions that are preventable and treatable through promoting changes in key human behaviors. The ability to change behaviors on a population scale, in an economically feasible way, is therefore likely to have a major impact on the cost of healthcare. In addition, healthy behaviors are typically associated with better quality of life and wellbeing.",,,,,

Since caring for individuals in assisted living and long-term care facilities costs nearly twice what it costs to care for their non-institutionalized counterparts, technologies that support aging in place are seen as one way to address this pressing problem. Among older adults, the groups at the highest risk for extensive care and services are individuals from rural areas, and underprivileged urban areas. Of these two sub-populations, rural individuals make up one fifth of the elderly population and are at highest-risk for requiring long-term care services and support. Similarly, urban-dwelling older adults in low-SES neighborhoods often experience higher rates of functional loss, and poorer overall health outcomes. In addition to stressing the long-term care resources of Medicare, these high-need older adults often require support from informal caregivers. Informal caregivers provide service that would otherwise cost the Medicare system $375 billion dollars a year. The average caregiver is employed, has children, and sixty-six percent of all informal caregivers in the U.S. are women. These caregivers are often called the ""sandwich generation"" because, in addition to traditional family and work roles, they must also provide care to an older adult relative. Thus, there is a huge need to ease the burden on these caregivers so that they can continue to provide the care required to keep older family members out of assisted living.<br/><br/>This project will provide guidance to community members, service providers, and governmental agencies about how to wield technology to enable low-SES, urban- and rural-dwelling older adults to age in place, while simultaneously easing the burden on caregivers. Specifically, the project will perform a needs analysis of these two groups, with an eye to how they are similar to and different from the higher-SES older adults for whom aging in place technologies have already been designed. The project will develop design guidelines to assist designers in targeting this high-need population, taking into account attributes such as proximity of caregivers, access to transportation, access to health services, technology infrastructure and attitudes towards technology. The project will then utilize these guidelines to customize a suite of existing technologies for the specific needs of these two populations. The technologies will be deployed in the homes of older adults in rural and urban settings so that the project can assess how older adults use such technologies and how well these technologies support their ability to age in place. The results will show how pioneering technologies developed in other contexts may be customized for use by low SES, urban- and rural-dwelling older adults. <br/><br/>The broader impact of this project include outreach to underserved communities, training of undergraduate and graduate students, broad dissemination of research results beyond traditional disciplinary silos, and building strong connections between academia, private companies, and government agencies, all of whom share the goal of enhancing the quality of life for underserved older adults. Finally, the broader impact in terms of benefits to society is inherent in the research; the project seeks to discover innovative ways of providing more appealing, less invasive, less costly options for caregivers and private and public payers, while simultaneously serving the underserved.",,,,,
